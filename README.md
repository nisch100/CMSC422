cmsc422-p1 includes various classifiers on datasets. (KNN, Epsilon ball, dt/binary)


cmsc422-p2
"The first part is about using reductions to solve complex classifiation problems (multiclass classification). The second is, in a sense, a continuation of P1 to build linear classifiers under various loss functions using (sub)gradient descent."

cmsc422-p3
Algorithms for dimensionality reducation and clustering. (PCA and kernel PCA)

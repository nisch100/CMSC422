<p>
<p><strong>What to submit:</strong> You will handin all of the python
  files listed above under "Files you'll edit" as well as
  a <tt>partners.txt</tt> file that lists the <b>names</b> and <b>last
  four digits of the UID</b> of all members in your team.  Finally,
  you'll hand in a <tt>writeup.pdf</tt> file that answers all the
  written questions in this assignment (denoted by <b>WU#:</b> in
  this <tt>.html</tt> file).<p/>

<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Your code will be autograded for
technical correctness. Please <em>do not</em> change the names of any
provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc
on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation --
not the autograder's output -- will be the final judge of your score.
If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to
ensure that you receive due credit for your work.

<p><strong>Academic Dishonesty:</strong> We will be checking your code
against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you
copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we will
know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don't
try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; <em>please</em>
don't let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest
consequences available to us.

<p><strong>Getting Help:</strong> You are not alone!  If you find
yourself stuck on something, contact the course staff for help.
Office hours, class time, and Piazza are there for your support;
please use them.  If you can't make our office hours, let us know and
we will schedule more.  We want these projects to be rewarding and
instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing.  But, we don't know
when or how to help unless you ask.  One more piece of advice: if you
don't know what a variable is, print it out.

<h3><a name="warmup">Warming Up to Classifiers</a> <i>(10%)</i></h3>

Let's begin our foray into classification by looking at some very
simple classifiers.  There are three classifiers
in <tt>dumbClassifiers.py</tt>, one is implemented for you, the other
two you will need to fill in appropriately.<p/>

The already implemented one is <tt>AlwaysPredictOne</tt>, a classifier
that (as its name suggest) always predicts the positive class.  We're
going to use the <tt>TennisData</tt> dataset from <tt>datasets.py</tt>
as a running example.  So let's start up python and see how well this
classifier does on this data.  You should begin by
importing <tt>util</tt>, <tt>datasets</tt>, <tt>binary</tt>
and <tt>dumbClassifiers</tt>.  Also, be sure you always have <tt>from
  numpy import *</tt> and <tt>from pylab import *</tt> activated.<p/>

<pre>
>>> h = dumbClassifiers.AlwaysPredictOne({})
>>> h
AlwaysPredictOne
>>> h.train(datasets.TennisData.X, datasets.TennisData.Y)
>>> h.predictAll(datasets.TennisData.X)
array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])
</pre>

Indeed, it looks like it's always predicting one!<p/>

Now, let's compare these predictions to the truth.  Here's a very
clever way to compute accuracies (<b>WU1:</b> why is this computation
equivalent to computing classification accuracy?):

<pre>
>>> mean((datasets.TennisData.Y > 0) == (h.predictAll(datasets.TennisData.X) > 0))
0.6428571428571429
</pre>

That's training accuracy; let's check test accuracy:

<pre>
>>> mean((datasets.TennisData.Yte > 0) == (h.predictAll(datasets.TennisData.Xte) > 0))
0.5
</pre>

Okay, so it does pretty badly.  That's not surprising, it's really not
learning anything!!!<p/>

Now, let's use some of the built-in functionality to help do some of
the grunt work for us.  You'll need to import <tt>runClassifier</tt>.

<pre>
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(h, datasets.TennisData)
Training accuracy 0.642857, test accuracy 0.5
</pre>

Very convenient!<p/>

Now, your first implementation task will be to implement the missing
functionality in <tt>AlwaysPredictMostFrequent</tt>.  This actually
will "learn" something simple.  Upon receiving training data, it will
simply remember whether +1 is more common or -1 is more common.  It
will then always predict this label for future data.  Once you've
implemented this, you can test it:

<pre>
>>> h = dumbClassifiers.AlwaysPredictMostFrequent({})
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(h, datasets.TennisData)
Training accuracy 0.642857, test accuracy 0.5
>>> h
AlwaysPredictMostFrequent(1)
</pre>

Okay, so it does the same as <tt>AlwaysPredictOne</tt>, but that's
because +1 is more common in that training data.  We can see a
difference if we change to a different dataset: <tt>GenderData</tt> is
the data you've seen before, now Python-ified.

<pre>
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dumbClassifiers.AlwaysPredictOne({}), datasets.GenderData)
Training accuracy 0.503168, test accuracy 0.489
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dumbClassifiers.AlwaysPredictMostFrequent({}), datasets.GenderData)
Training accuracy 0.503168, test accuracy 0.489
</pre>

Since the majority class is "1", these do the same here.<p/>

The last dumb classifier we'll implement
is <tt>FirstFeatureClassifier</tt>.  This actually does something
slightly non-trivial.  It looks at the first feature
(i.e., <tt>X[0]</tt>) and uses this to make a prediction.  Based on
the training data, it figures out what is the most common class for
the case when <tt>X[0] > 0</tt> and the most common class for the case
when <tt>X[0] <= 0</tt>.  Upon receiving a test point, it checks the
value of <tt>X[0]</tt> and returns the corresponding class.  Once
you've implemented this, you can check it's performance:

<pre>
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dumbClassifiers.FirstFeatureClassifier({}), datasets.TennisData)
Training accuracy 0.714286, test accuracy 0.666667
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dumbClassifiers.FirstFeatureClassifier({}), datasets.GenderData)
Training accuracy 0.504668, test accuracy 0.4905
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dumbClassifiers.FirstFeatureClassifier({}), datasets.SentimentData)
Training accuracy 0.516667, test accuracy 0.49
</pre>


<h3><a name="dt">Decision Trees</a> <i>(30%)</i></h3>

Our next task is to implement a decision tree classifier.  There is
stub code in <tt>dt.py</tt> that you should edit.  Decision trees are
stored as simple data structures.  Each node in the tree has
a <tt>.isLeaf</tt> boolean that tells us if this node is a leaf (as
opposed to an internal node).  Leaf nodes have a <tt>.label</tt> field
that says what class to return at this leaf.  Internal nodes have:
a <tt>.feature</tt> value that tells us what feature to split on;
a <tt>.left</tt> <i>tree</i> that tells us what to do when the feature
value is <i>less than 0.5</i>; and a <tt>.right</tt> <i>tree</i> that
tells us what to do when the feature value is <i>at least 0.5</i>.
To get a sense of how the data structure works, look at
the <tt>displayTree</tt> function that prints out a tree.<p/>

Your first task is to implement the training procedure for decision
trees.  We've provided a fair amount of the code, which should help
you guard against corner cases.  (Hint: take a look
at <tt>util.py</tt> for some useful functions for implementing
training.  Once you've implemented the training function, we can test
it on simple data:<p/>

<pre>
>>> h = dt.DT({'maxDepth': 1})
>>> h
Leaf 1

>>> h.train(datasets.TennisData.X, datasets.TennisData.Y)
>>> h
Branch 6
  Leaf 1.0
  Leaf -1.0
</pre>

This is for a simple depth-one decision tree (aka a decision stump).
If we let it get deeper, we get things like:

<pre>
>>> h = dt.DT({'maxDepth': 2})
>>> h.train(datasets.TennisData.X, datasets.TennisData.Y)
>>> h
Branch 6
  Branch 7
    Leaf 1.0
    Leaf 1.0
  Branch 1
    Leaf -1.0
    Leaf 1.0

>>> h = dt.DT({'maxDepth': 5})
>>> h.train(datasets.TennisData.X, datasets.TennisData.Y)
>>> h
Branch 6
  Branch 7
    Leaf 1.0
    Branch 2
      Leaf 1.0
      Leaf -1.0
  Branch 1
    Branch 7
      Branch 2
        Leaf -1.0
        Leaf 1.0
      Leaf -1.0
    Leaf 1.0
</pre>

We can do something similar on the gender data:

<pre>
>>> h = dt.DT({'maxDepth': 2})
>>> h.train(datasets.GenderData.X, datasets.GenderData.Y)
>>> h
Branch 748
  Branch 287
    Leaf 1.0
    Leaf -1.0
  Branch 71
    Leaf -1.0
    Leaf 1.0
</pre>

The problem here is that words have been converted into numeric ids
for features. We can look them up:

<pre>
>>> GenderData.words[748]
'me'
>>> GenderData.words[287]
'love'
>>> GenderData.words[71]
'urllink'
</pre>

(This last one means "contained a URL reference".) Based on this, we
can rewrite the tree (by hand) as:

<pre>
Branch 'me'
  Branch 'love'
    Leaf 1.0
    Leaf -1.0
  Branch 'urllink'
    Leaf -1.0
    Leaf 1.0
</pre>

Now, you should go implement prediction.  This should be easier than
training!  We can test by:

<pre>
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dt.DT({'maxDepth': 1}), datasets.GenderData)
Training accuracy 0.555018, test accuracy 0.553
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dt.DT({'maxDepth': 3}), datasets.GenderData)
Training accuracy 0.589363, test accuracy 0.5725
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dt.DT({'maxDepth': 5}), datasets.GenderData)
Training accuracy 0.616539, test accuracy 0.573
</pre>

Or:

<pre>
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dt.DT({'maxDepth': 1}), datasets.SentimentData)
Training accuracy 0.630833, test accuracy 0.595
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dt.DT({'maxDepth': 3}), datasets.SentimentData)
Training accuracy 0.700833, test accuracy 0.6225
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(dt.DT({'maxDepth': 5}), datasets.SentimentData)
Training accuracy 0.759167, test accuracy 0.6275
</pre>

Looks like it does better than the dumb classifiers on training data,
as well as on test data!  Hopefully we can do even better in the
future!<p/>

We can use more <tt>runClassifier</tt> functions to generate learning
curves and hyperparameter curves:

<pre>
>>> curve = runClassifier.learningCurveSet(dt.DT({'maxDepth': 9}), datasets.GenderData)
[snip]
>>> runClassifier.plotCurve('DT on Gender Data', curve)
</pre>

This plots training and test accuracy as a function of the number of
data points (x-axis) used for training.

<b>WU2:</b> We should see training accuracy (roughly) going down and
test accuracy (roughly) going up.  Why does training accuracy tend to
go <i>down?</i>  Why is test accuracy not monotonically
increasing?<p/>

We can also generate similar curves by chaning the maximum depth
hyperparameter:

<pre>
>>> curve = runClassifier.hyperparamCurveSet(dt.DT({}), 'maxDepth', [1,2,4,8,16,32], datasets.GenderData)
[snip]
>>> runClassifier.plotCurve('DT on Gender Data (hyperparameter)', curve)
</pre>

Now, the x-axis is the value of the maximum depth.<p/>

<b>WU3:</b> You should see training accuracy monotonically increasing
and test accuracy making a (wavy) hill.  Which of these
is <i>guaranteed</i> to happen a which is just something we might
expect to happen?  Why?<p/>

<h3><a name="knn">Nearest Neighbors <i>(30%)</i></a></h3>

To get started with geometry-based classification, we will implement a
nearest neighbor classifier that supports both KNN classification and
epsilon-ball classification.  This should go in <tt>knn.py</tt>.  The
only function here that you have to do anything about is
the <tt>predict</tt> function, which does all the work.<p/>

In order to test your implementation, here are some outputs (I suggest
implementing epsilon-balls first, since they're slightly easier):

<pre>
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': False, 'eps': 0.5}), datasets.TennisData)
Training accuracy 1, test accuracy 1
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': False, 'eps': 1.0}), datasets.TennisData)
Training accuracy 0.857143, test accuracy 0.833333
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': False, 'eps': 2.0}), datasets.TennisData)
Training accuracy 0.642857, test accuracy 0.5

>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': True, 'K': 1}), datasets.TennisData)
Training accuracy 1, test accuracy 1
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': True, 'K': 3}), datasets.TennisData)
Training accuracy 0.785714, test accuracy 0.833333
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': True, 'K': 5}), datasets.TennisData)
Training accuracy 0.857143, test accuracy 0.833333
</pre>

You can also try it on the digits data:

<pre>
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': False, 'eps': 6.0}), datasets.DigitData)
Training accuracy 0.96, test accuracy 0.64
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': False, 'eps': 8.0}), datasets.DigitData)
Training accuracy 0.88, test accuracy 0.81
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': False, 'eps': 10.0}), datasets.DigitData)
Training accuracy 0.74, test accuracy 0.74

>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': True, 'K': 1}), datasets.DigitData)
Training accuracy 1, test accuracy 0.94
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': True, 'K': 3}), datasets.DigitData)
Training accuracy 0.94, test accuracy 0.93
>>> runClassifier.trainTestSet(knn.KNN({'isKNN': True, 'K': 5}), datasets.DigitData)
Training accuracy 0.92, test accuracy 0.92
</pre>

<b>WU4:</b> For the digits data, generate train/test curves for
varying values of K and epsilon (you figure out what are good ranges,
this time).  Include those curves: do you see evidence of overfitting
and underfitting?  Next, using K=5, generate learning curves for this
data.<p/>

<b>WU5:</b> Modify HighD.py appropriately for the following
experiment. The digits (training) data consists of 100 points in 784
dimensions, and lives in the [0,1]<sup>784</sup> hypercube. First,
generate a histogram plot of equivalent, randomly generated data (this
is basically just using HighD.py directly). Next, generate a histogram
of distances computed from DigitData.X. Spend a few sentences
discussing what you see.

<h3><a name="tools">Using Tools <i>(30%)</i></a></h3>

You've already, in Lab1, used FastDT. The following write-up questions
are a subset of those from that lab.<p/>

<b>WU6:</b> Build a depth 3 decision tree on the (lab1) sentiment
data. Draw it. Explain what the tree is doing. (1:E+F from lab1)<p/>

<b>WU7:</b> Draw error rate curves for different depths of decision
trees on the (lab1) gender data. Answer questions B+C from Part 2 of
lab1.</p>

Finally, for the final 10% of your grade, for extra credit, and for
bragging rights, you get to solve a very weird classification
problem. The task is: given what a person is saying (dialog from a
book), predict their mood! In this case, mood is either happy (class
1) or sad (class -1). A "small" version of the training data is in
quotes.training (there are 30k examples). A test set is in
quotes.te. Note that all the labels in quotes.te have been set to
ZERO, so you don't get to peek at the true labels. Your job is to use
anything you've developed in this project, as well as FastDT, to get
the best possible performance you can on this test data. Every night
at midnight we will evaluate your submission and post the results to
the <b><a href="leaderboard.html">leaderboard</a></b>, marked by your
teamname (specified in <tt>teamname.txt</tt>). If you beat my baseline
(called Hal9000) you get 5%. For every one percent better than my
baseline you do, you get another 1% (up to 5% more). Finally, the
first place team will get 10% EC, the second place 5% and the third
place 2%. Please <b>WU8</b> writeup what you did.

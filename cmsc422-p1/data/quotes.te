0	do you dare to threaten me , a loyal englishman , you false priest and foreign traitor , whom all men know to be in the pay of spain , and using the cover of a monk 's dress to plot against the land on which you fatten like a horse-leech ? why was john foterell murdered in the forest two nights gone ? you will not answer ? then i will . because he rode to court to prove the truth about you and your treachery , and therefore you butchered him . why do you claim my wife as your ward ? because you wish to steal her lands and goods to feed your plots and luxury . you think you have bought friends at court , and that for money 's sake those in power there will turn a blind eye to your crimes . so it may be for a while ; but wait , wait . all eyes are not blind yonder , nor all ears deaf . that head of yours shall yet be lifted higher than you think -- so high that it sticks upon the top of blossholme towers , a warning to all who would sell england to her enemies . john foterell lies dead with your knave 's arrow in his throat , but jeffrey stokes is away with the writings . and now do your worst , clement maldon . if you want my wife , come take her .
0	he says you can come in , " yah ! you ' re too easy on him , " growled scorch , and went off to do as he was bid . when he came back he did not look very pleasant .
0	sure ! she 's workin ' beautiful . just look at that stream . you --
0	if it were no worse than that ! " for no reason in the world . this liberal view comes the easier to me that i do not expect ever to see the interesting treasures you may have collected from peyron 's and janetti 's " .
0	to recount her virtues , she has a right to be like an april day .
0	i ' d like to see some one choke a river , you try to choke a river and you will find that the harder you clutch it the more trouble it will make you .
0	oh , now i know ! she 's the big fat one with curls hangin ' round her yeahs like shavin 's . i do not like her , mom beck . she keeps a-kissin ' me all the time , an ' a- ' queezin ' me , an ' tellin ' me to sit on her lap an ' be a little lady . mom beck , i de ' pise to be a little lady .
0	i ' d hate to have him haul off and hit me with that fist of his ! how are you going to celebrate the day , scouts ?
0	no , sir ; not dead . recovering ! she has fallen just now into a normal sleep ; her breathing is natural . he gazed up at me abstractedly , his brow contracting . " yes , yes ; i know , " he interrupted . " the girl in fourteen . i have discounted her case long ago . she has ceased to interest me . dead , of course ! nothing else was possible " .
0	go on ! what is the matter , _bella mia_ ?
0	i ' m not the _night_ operator , what 's the matter with jane swiggers and lucy cummings ? they ' re supposed to be on duty all night .
0	i have not the least idea how to go about being unnatural , but , thank heaven , i do not have to learn to-day ! margery is feeling better and is going to let me stay with her . " but they will not patronize you if you are a little more reserved . there 's no earthly reason for your telling them that you keep only one servant , and saying that you come from billy-goat hill . it 's a horrid name given our beautiful hillside , by horrid people . you see , you really must cultivate more caution . you are , -- what shall i say ? too frank , too natural " .
0	captain shelton be damned ! keep your name to yourself , sims , and watch the nigger and the boy . now , shelton , for the reason why i ' m here .

0	what does this fellow want ? pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest , filled with metal articles . other french soldiers standing below went up to the drawer .

0	the power of the purse again ! now that you are here , i do not believe that you are a bit glad to see me . are you ?
0	that shows how much you know about law , my uncle 's got a friend who 's a lawyer . if this sign has a right here we have a right here because we ' re part of the sign . you can , ask mr . bull who works for brown 's hats if we ' re not . do you see what it says on this sign ? always on top ? that means us . it means us just as much as the hats . we belong here , so there .
0	come back ! i will go .
0	bears ! five !
0	once for all , i intend to look after this unfortunate syrian ! if my friends object , i shall be deeply sorry ; but , so far as i care , they may object until they are purple in the face and their tongues hang out . i have been sending my money to foreign missions long enough ; i ' m doing my missionary work at home now .

0	come back . there 's no lariats there . they ' re all in the pack down at the bottom of the canyon , " i will get a lariat . that surely ought to be long enough , " said walter , darting away to the ponies .
0	children ! " why , you -- " mars started .
0	do not talk about it ! " say leon , you found the station , did not you " ?
0	eight hundred , when this was restored ayoub at once raised the price to seven hundred .

0	shut that door ! he was interrupted by the opening of the door . an icy draft swept down the length of the store .
0	well , mollie , you are a nice one ! kindly ' put us on , ' as the saying goes . what have you planned ?
0	do you say such nasty things about me ? " i ' d rather be called sentimental than frozen meat , " fanny blurted . paul knew she referred to clara , and he smiled .
0	no ! " do you remember coming to me one day -- two days after valentine day , it was -- white as chalk and shaking like a leaf , and -- "
0	i ' m to have a sign ! " show me , " i said , turning on her . " heal me " !
0	be quiet , thou -- ! " the officer excellency lied -- " ! said zaidee .
0	no , you can not have a horse . i have them out here for work , not to run about , " tomorrow is sunday and one team will be idle . i want to get back to my sunday-school class and to meet with the people in church once more . i will not ride fast if you will let me have a horse " .
0	immensely . never , i think , so much as now . that sounds of a grossness , does not it ? but your announcement really lights up the mind .
0	nonsense ! socialistic nonsense ! trusts may be unprincipled , but they do not commit individual crimes .
0	i will not break your confidence -- unless you have murdered some one , in that event you ' d better keep quiet , as i ' d have to haul you back to headquarters .
0	yes , the explosion had evidently been heard all over the village .
0	still nursing that grievance over your sex , i thought you would outgrow it .
0	i make no more of such wings than if they were those of farmyard geese , bring her or i will pluck her forth .
0	well , out here , we do not mind waiting a day or so , but i suppose you folks from back in the east get in more of a hurry . anyhow , we will promise you a good time .
0	yea , as we did , friend michael , when we were thieves ; whereas now we be lords and gentlemen . but as to thy tidings , i set not much by them ; for of the same message was this word that they had already fallen on higham by the way ; and we know that this cannot be true ; since though forsooth the abbot has had unpeace on his hands , we know where his foemen came from , the west to wit , and the banded barons . spake michael a-hurst : " by thy leave , fair sir , we have had a word of those riders and strong-thieves that they have fetched a far compass , and got them armour , and be come into the woodland north of the wood debateable . for like all strong-thieves , they love the wood " .
0	but me no more buts , we be jammed in a clove-hitch , as the seaman 's lingo hath it . take trouble as it comes and , ware ye , do not weaken .
0	celia , celia ! do not be scared . uncle joel 's coming .
0	i have an uncanny way of feeling things on my face before they touch me . i experimented somewhat with it in the laboratory at college . it 's a sort of tropism , perhaps , such as bugs have , that enables them to keep between two planks or that turns plant-roots toward the sun . anyway , i have brought some breakfast . these berries may be good , and these other things may be toadstools . i brought them along . when he reached the rock , it was characteristic of her that she said : " you came through those trees remarkably well " .
0	oh , dear no ! that 's what he brought us up here for ; did not you , uncle toby ?
0	you are young , or you would not empty the magazine all at once in answer to a single shot . " no , " he said . " to be frank , i came out because my friends in the old one seemed to fancy the same thing of me . when they have no great use for a young man yonder , they generally send him to america . in fact , they send some of them quite a nice cheque quarterly so long as they stay there . you see , we are like the hedgehogs , or your porcupines , if you grow them here , miss schuyler " .
0	yes , yes , that is the best way ; we will see the king with our own eyes !
0	but do not you think you need it , also " maype , if i go in for dis sort of thing , i crowd out some young mans who needs it as much as you do , " retorted the german , blinking .
0	my friends , danaan warriors , servants of mars , let no man lag that he may spoil the dead , and bring back much booty to the ships . let us kill as many as we can ; the bodies will lie upon the plain , and you can despoil them later at your leisure . thus did he speak , and his brother was persuaded by him , for his words were just . menelaus , therefore , thrust adrestus from him , whereon king agamemnon struck him in the flank , and he fell : then the son of atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his spear from the body .
0	no , i shall remember the red heels of versailles , english bread and butter , and the gipsy caravan . " we should have ; but our great-grandfather was guillotined in paris during the terror , and his wife and child came to england . years later , when they might have gone back they would not . why should they ? napoleon had given the avenel estates to one of his ruffians , who had since seceded to the bourbon and so made all secure . besides , they were happy enough . marie louis hilaire gave music lessons , and the marquise scrubbed and cooked and patched their clothes -- she , who had been the queen 's friend , and so they managed to keep the little home together . presently the young man married , and then jean marie appeared on the scene . we have a picture of him at the age of five , in a nankeen frock and a frill . our mother was a hungarian -- hence jean 's music , i suppose -- and there is romany blood on that side . these are our antecedents . you will not be surprised at our vagaries now " ?
0	what ! mrs . de graf gave a jump and crushed the newspaper into her lap .
0	oh , mr . breckon ! is it you ? oh , do tell them i did not mean to do anything ! i thought she beckoned to me .

0	the devil es blawin ' hes billies ( bellows ) to-night , i followed him again , and had scarcely reached the beach when a sound like the crack of a musket reached our ears .
0	yes , and see that you make a thorough job of it .
0	theoretically that 's true now -- but in fact , i ' d like to be able to walk down the street in uniform and not have half the sidewalk to myself . it did not surprise her particularly that it was the inquisitors who most wanted to take advantage of the sealing . their work , done properly , was a constant strain , with the accompanying urge to take out their frustrations on a subject -- or not do what was needed to get vital information . the line between the warrant-protected violence of their duties and the sin of giving in to personal weakness was a thin one , easy to rationalize crossing . . . " i ' m praying for you and everyone else who wants his protection , " cortin said . " and i ' m beginning to believe being sealed is going to be necessary for inquisitors in his kingdom . we may never be loved , but having truthsense and being in a constant state of grace , we should at least be trusted , and only criminals will have any reason to be afraid of us " .
0	abdallah ! why do not you take this man away ? why do not you make him understand that if all the pyramids depended on it , i would not give him sixpence !

0	we have had a fine passage , and there was no excuse for an old salt like you to be sick , " i have enjoyed myself every moment of the voyage , and have never been sick a single hour , " she replied .
0	it 's your birthday , too , you dear old stupid ! " nannie , " he said , " this marks an epoch ; and it 's constance 's birthday " .
0	it 's always the way . who remembers a kodak until it is needed , " how stupid of us to leave it home , " added barbara .
0	that is a suggestion which should have come from me , sir , it is out of place upon your lips . it is not the thought of a loyal son . why , sir , if my father had been plunged in such deplorable circumstances , i should have thrashed the editor of that vile sheet within an inch of his life . i should have thrashed the man , sir . it would have been the action of an ass ; but it would have shown that i had the blood and the natural affections of a man . son ? you are no son , no son of mine , sir !
0	the side door ! the crowd surged forward again . but the props held firm . again and again the mob hurled itself upon the thick doors . they bent , they sagged , but they held . don mario became apoplectic . a torrent of anathemas streamed from his thick lips .
0	well , myles , what is it ? will not you tell me ? why did you try and frighten me ?
0	for that little tale , never ! that has not a bit of literary merit . it has not one rounded period .
0	why , that 's dr . jervis 's carriage , what can be up ?
0	light ? i feel gay ! with fulkerson at the helm , i tell you the rocks and the lee shore had better keep out of the way . just when you think fulkerson has taken leave of his senses he says or does something that shows he is on the most intimate and inalienable terms with them all the time . you know how i have been worrying over those foreign periodicals , and trying to get some translations from them for the first number ? well , fulkerson has brought his centipedal mind to bear on the subject , and he 's suggested that old german friend of mine i was telling you of -- the one i met in the restaurant -- the friend of my youth .
0	three up at the turn for the army , the next hole was also a five bogey ; but again bob , who reached the green in two , got out in four , while trevanion took five . he had reduced the difference between them to three . the ninth hole was halved .
0	stacy is wise beyond his years , when he is grown up i look for him to be a very clever young man .
0	hush your mouth ! you confounded rascal ! are you going to mention that name here ?
0	ah ! that 's like cinderella , will the stroke of the clock change all the carriages in paris into pumpkins ? one can get ' fiacres ' at any hour .
0	stand by ready for the emergency valve ! at any moment the steel plates were likely to cave in under the strain and the submarine be inundated .
0	truly , we have fooled the allies exquisitely , but if i am denounced , you also will be discovered as my associate , as well as st rmer , fredericks , and our other friends .
0	i always heard that sick men were children , and i can see that you are quite ill because you are such a child . we shall take you home now and feed you up on cream and eggs , providing we can get any .
0	can we ? mr . longdon thought . " we can at least respect ourselves " .
0	oh , yes , there 's no danger of our hoarding money . there are too many things to spend it on for that .
0	it is the region , in which my soul dwells . my shawl , peyton , if you please -- the breeze comes a little chilly from yon verdured hills .
0	you have got it ! he was short of something , at all events . it may have been skill , and it may have been legs , or discretion ; but , whatever was lacking , at the third or fourth stroke the oar-blades went a little too deeply below the smooth surface of the water ; there was a vain tug , a little out of " time , " and then there was a boy on the bottom of the boat , and a pair of well-polished shoes lifted high in the air .
0	converted what ? " a little bit wild , " said his visitor again . " sam burge , the converted burglar , a little bit wild . well , well " !
0	that 's better , now , i will leave you two together for the moment .
0	of course he will , " do not you do anything of the sort , " shouted gosse ; " you ' re are as good as that lot . stick in " !
0	oh , has he ? i ' d like to know when ? he 's been more of a plague the last six weeks than ever in his life before . when he upset that milk last night i could have cuffed him . it 's the third time since wednesday . mark , indeed ! the only mark he will ever make is a dirt-mark on clean floors . the kitchen looks like sancho at this moment . i have washed it up twice as often as ordinary , but as sure as i get it clean , in he comes stamping about with his muddy boots and tracks it from end to end . i believe he does it a-purpose .
0	you ' re showing yourself now , duke thornton ! you have used us like you ' d use school-boys for fifty years , but you ai not dared to brag of it till now !
0	he ! he ! excuse me . ca not help it . very funny . you chaps act like you thought i ' d bite . i will not bite . never bit a man in all my life . however , i see you are determined to go away without me , and i will not try to force myself upon you . if there is anything i detest it is a man who makes himself obnoxious by forcing himself on others . he ! he !

0	' llo , toyman , ' llo , toyman ! but first he must find the toyman . that is what he had come for . and the toyman had just gone over that very road . marmaduke had seen him from the valley below , his long legs climbing up that hill and the little boy had hurried after him , calling and calling .
0	to die on my hands ? not i ! my collection is complete enough .

0	then why did not he _do_ right ? why did not he go back after that young woman , and take care of her ? huh ? what was holding him ?
0	well , penloe , i have been thinking that i would like to take you over to see an old friend of mine , who has sore eyes . you have never seen him , and he would be so pleased to have us come ; for he must have many lonely times , because very few persons ever call on him , and , penloe , dear , we have such a lot of good things left from aunt 's big wedding dinner that she gave us , and i thought we would take some of the nice things along with us for the old man to enjoy . he seldom has anything very good to eat . penloe smiled , and said : " i am perfectly willing to obey such a wife as you are . what are your orders , my dear " ?
0	why , of course we will cut down things , we can live on a great deal less , and i will market so carefully that you will hardly know the difference . i will put marthy in the kitchen and take care of the children myself . it will not be the least bit of trouble .

0	it 's the only kind of ideas i have . but there are ten thousand reasons why i want to go . in the first place , i fairly itch to give pills . you say the rebels have no hospitals , no nurses -- alvarado inquired , " what ever put such a ridiculous idea into your head " ?
0	oh , it 's a sweet morning ! sweet ! we will go on ! i ' m terribly excited ! it was not so much that the sun was shining , in the morning , as that a ripple of fresh breeze came through the window . she discovered that she again longed to go on -- keep going on -- see new places , conquer new roads . she did not want all good road . she wanted something to struggle against . she ' d try it for one more day . she was stiff as she crawled out of bed , but a rub with cold water left her feeling that she was stronger than she ever had been ; that she was a woman , not a dependent girl . already , in the beating prairie sun-glare , the wide main street of gopher prairie was drying ; the mud ruts flattening out . beyond the town hovered the note of a meadow lark -- sunlight in sound .

0	' tis i where i sit , thou offensive monkey !

0	the man is a fortune hunter , but he 's taking the right way . she 's used to admiration , and her other suitors have , no doubt , deferred to her . it 's a change to be defied instead of courted , and though it makes her angry i imagine it strengthens his hold . if he shows his is the firmer hand , she will give in . " i thought he meant to flout her when he acted on her suggestion , and i half expected something of a scene , " said mrs . ashborne . " the woman has a temper " .
0	i suppose your next advice will be to submit it to the magazines . " i wish you ' d type it for me , " he said . " you know how a thousand times better than any stenographer . and now i want to give you some advice " . he drew a bulky manuscript from his outside coat pocket . " here 's your ' shame of the sun end_sentence_quote i have read it not once , but twice and three times -- the highest compliment i can pay you . after what you have said about ' ephemera ' i must be silent . but this i will say : when ' the shame of the sun ' is published , it will make a hit . it will start a controversy that will be worth thousands to you just in advertising " .

0	stop , grant at the window could see the crowd marching from the hot dog to dick 's place , yelling and cursing as it went . the group in the bedroom over the street opened the street windows to see better and hear better . an incandescent over the door of the saloon lighted the narrow street . in front of the saloon and under the light the mob halted . the men in the room with grant were at the windows watching . suddenly -- as by some prearranged order , four men with revolvers in their hands ran across the street towards the hotel . brotherton , williams and perry ran to the head of the stairs , guns in hand . grant followed them . there they stood when the door below was thrown open , and the four men below rushed across the small landing to the bottom of the stairs . it was dark in the upper hall , but a light from the street flooded the lower hall . the men below did not look up ; they were on the stairs .

0	anyhow , you ' re good company , old mississip ' !
0	where i came from , when we were not paid for our work we always stopped to consider our health -- and the weather . i do not want a great deal . i put it to you honestly . do you want me ? if you do , will you give me enough to live on -- enough to buy a suit of clothes a year , to pay for food and a room ? if i work for you for nothing , i have to live on others for nothing , or kill myself as you ' re doing . " then where have you lived " ? snapped out the tailor with a sneer . " you must be a yankee -- they have only what we leave over down there " ! -- he jerked his head southward .

0	simple are ye folk of the burg and know nought of her shifts . i tell thee it is not unlike that she is in the burg even now , and hath in hand to take out of your prison the four whom ye have caught . then said roger in a surly voice , " why art thou not there to look on " ? " because , " quoth the man , " there is little to see there , and not much more to hearken . the thieves shall be speedily judged , and not questioned with torments , so that they may be the lustier to feel what the hangman shall work on them to-morrow ; then forsooth the show shall be goodly . but far better had it been if we had had in our hands the great witch of these dastards , as we looked to have her ; but now folk say that she has not been brought within gates , and it is to be feared that she hath slipped through our fingers once more " .

0	you are a cure , " i have got a club-foot , " he said . " have you any objection " ?
0	whom ? " it is so . i have never seen her ; but his eminence has , and ' t is he who arranges the affair . ah , the cardinal is the greatest match maker in france ! my cousin anna martinozzi is destined for the prince de conti , my sisters olympia and marianne he also hopes to marry to princes of the blood , whilst i dare wager that he has thoughts of seating either maria or hortensia upon the throne of france as the wife of louis xiv . , as soon as his majesty shall have reached a marriageable age . you may laugh , de luynes , nevertheless all this may come to pass , for my uncle has great ambitions for his family , and it is even possible that should that poor , wandering youth , charles ii . of england , ever return to the throne of his fathers he may also become my brother-in-law . i am likely to become well connected , de luynes , so make a friend of me whilst i am humble . so much for mazarin 's nieces . his nephews are too young for alliances just yet , saving myself ; and for me his eminence has chosen one of the greatest heiresses in france -- yvonne st . albaret de canaples " .

0	no , philip looked on , and a greater depression seized him than he remembered to have felt for a long time . he felt intolerably alone . he did not go , because he was afraid to seem supercilious , and he talked with the girls and laughed , but in his heart was unhappiness . miss bennett asked him if he had a girl .
0	come back ! come back , or i will fire !
0	not at all . captain john gunner was dead , all right . as the medical evidence proved , he died of the bite of a cobra . it was a small cobra which came from java . this time mr . snyder spoke .

0	it assuredly does not mean the approach of night . " things seem to open up before me like a sunrise , but what it means i can not say " .
0	and donkeys like you are queerest of all , " hee-haw ! i declare " ! exclaimed the king . " it seems each one of you wants a different food . how queer all living creatures are , except donkeys " !

0	you let me starve but will not let me sleep . why does not any one help me ? i will get the fever . what have i done ? " my dear child shall go to heaven like a princess , " she said ; and she sat at her work table to fashion a robe of fine cambric and lace for her dead .
0	i do not follow mr . gourlay at all , i follow nobody but myself ! every man in the district 's in support of this petition . it would be absurd to suppose anything else . i will be glad to sig not among the first , and do everything i can in its support .
0	but they will give the alarm and cause us to be followed ! " for one thing , " said ranjoor singh , without any resentment in his voice that i could detect ( although that was no sign ) ! , " i had to make some sort of bargain with them , and having made it i must keep it . the money with which i bribed the captain and his mate would have been of little use to them unless i allowed them life and liberty as well " .

0	your tact has saved the situation , petrie , it failed you momentarily , though , when you proposed to me just now that we should muster the lascars for inspection . our game is to pretend that we know nothing -- that we believe k raman h to have had a bad dream .

0	that is easy enough to explain , harris is a natural gambler . he delights in excitement and danger , and he actually enjoys taking such desperate ventures .

0	he is stuck , no , i ' d better give you my version . there you reckon on your fingers the forces that make up the circles . all that business of titles and sentimentalism is a very good cement , but there is something better ; persuade four members of the circle to do for a fifth on the pretence that he is a traitor , and you will tie them all together with the blood they have shed as though it were a knot . they will be your slaves , they will not dare to rebel or call you to account . ha ha ha !
0	on the second ballot , just as young fisbee planned it , weeks ago .
0	and did the course of true love for once run smooth , " and was it love at first sight " ? asked fanny .

0	i -- i -- oh , my good land ! marietta tried , but she could do little but gurgle . she gurgled , however , in her natural tones , or a frightened imitation of them . little cherry blossom had , apparently , fluttered to the chinese spiritland .

0	what have they done ? i just went into the pantry and opened the closet door and out jumped about a thousand mice at me !
0	so am i , caught in the web , lost in it -- to my own surprise . burns , by the way , came to ecclefechan , where we ' re arriving now . he had an uproarious time , and wrote verses to the lass of ecclefechan , which shows the place must have been a good deal livelier then than now . or else , which is as likely , he had a faculty of squeezing the juice out of the driest , most unpromising fruit -- the same faculty you have .

0	she thinks of such funny things ! things that nobody else would ever dream of doing .
0	here , you bridget , or nancy , or whatever your name is , there 's a lunatic upstairs , making a tremendous row in the room over mine . if you do not stop him i will leave the hotel . hear him now !
0	what 's that you say ? he thought the marking of coins a mean trick , and the dragging-in of bad trade and his mother 's birthday roused a familiar devil that usually slept quietly in his breast .
0	hallo ! what 's wrong ? the next hill they came to was a still worse one . when they were half-way down the leader came to a sudden halt ; grant 's cariole almost ran over it ; sam and the luggage-cart pulled up just in time , and so , from front to rear , they were jammed up into the smallest space they could occupy .
0	what ' d you wing him for ? he was drawin ' on you . kickin ' men like him will not do out here .
0	do it right away ! " not much ! if i can not play on the eleven , i know what i will do -- i will pack my trunk and go home " !
0	here ! wake up , joe ! here 's a bottle of tears .
0	oh that 's it , is it ? it is love that made you want to break the knocker ? why did not you go round to the back ? which of them is it ? the cook , of course . you look hungry . a kandidat crying after a cook ! klutz really felt ill . he leaned on dellwig 's arm and let himself be helped along , the energy gone out of him with the fury . " you have never loved , " was all he said , wiping his eyes .
0	there goes one of the dogs ! that 's too bad .
0	sherlock shaw , the scout sleuth ! instantly the others jumped to their feet , slapping frank 's shoulders , shaking his hands and otherwise showing their appreciation of his shrewdness . their enthusiasm could scarcely be restrained .
0	they never seemed very happy about it , though , well , it 's time to go down again , and be off for windsor . and then to-morrow morning we will be off for the seashore . we ' re to camp there , right on the beach , instead of living in a house . that will be much better , i think .
0	there 's no doubt of that , " no ; we have spoiled all our chances " .
0	ah that 's another question ! the point is of what use is your declining to know me when to know mr . newsome -- as you do me the honour to find him -- is just to know me .
0	sir ! there is the door !
0	mr . lyle , we are ahead of time .
0	clear out ! dress mighty damn quick and clear out !
0	help grab the girl -- we will take care of the man ! a chorus of amazed voices now mingled with the noise of the water dashing against the wall and the ringing of the buoy , and tom began to feel faint and dazed . but almost before he knew what was happening , a powerful grip caught him on his thick hair , and he was dragged partly out of the water .
0	there , there , you must sit quite straight . that 's a nice child , phronsie . and see here ! i must take you sometime in my carriage when i go on my calls . will you go , phronsie ? " yes , we are , " declared phronsie , bending forward to see his work the better , and taking her eyes from his face .
0	i ' m afraid not , " how much ? pf " ! he snapped his fingers . " can i turn them into gold " ?
0	not exactly , but -- oh well , i do not believe in explanations . you will see things for your-self , perhaps . and now i will get you a book . i will not warn you not to move for i know you can not .

0	yes ! no sooner out of prison than they rush to their work .
0	and so we must make new resolutions , " then there was a small baby ; he was rightly named squealer , " added uncle squeaky dryly . " well , one stormy night when the snow was packed against the windows so you could not even peep out , their old uncle made them a visit . he reminded them that once again it was new year 's eve " . he paused solemnly .
0	then you think my views on license , and food-inspection , and tenement-house regulation are ' deformities ' ? " no . a party is seldom retained in power for such reasons . if it has a long tenure of office it is generally due to popular distrust of the other party . the natural tendency otherwise is to make office-holding a sort of see-saw . let alone change of opinion in older men , there are enough new voters every four years to reverse majorities in almost every state . of course these young men care little for what either party has done in the past , and being young and ardent , they want to change things . the minority 's ready to please them , naturally . reform they call it , but it 's quite as often ' deform ' when they have done it " .
0	it is still in a general sense , it is only when the amplifier of the wireless magnifies the sounds that we realize how many of them our ears fail to hear .
0	are you coming up ? " tell -- tell _who_ " ? cried anderson blankly . suddenly he sprang to his companion 's side ; seizing him by the arm , he whispered hoarsely : " by gosh , i thought there was somethin ' queer about that gang . have you got any of the gold here ? i recollect that feller 's voice , plain as day . they ' re after the gold . they have heard about -- "
0	of course , you ' re a mere baby -- but a dear baby , betty mine . she sighed a little . " am i such a child " ?
0	look out ! go slowly , or we shall smash into the rocks .
0	no , i say that for you . she likes your liking her ; it 's so much , as it were , to the good . however , she does not despair of sarah either , and is prepared , on her own side , to go all lengths .
0	they never do ! but i agree with you -- and yet , it is lovely ! her eyes were always wonderful , and she smiles like some old picture . i shall love her well , richard . he put something in her hand . " would you like to see it ? she sent it to me , two weeks ago . it does not do her justice " .
0	that 's the hawk ! though that tickling business you speak of is when i spiral . do not you like it ?
0	i do not see it now but i saw it a moment ago , i ' m sure i did . come on -- over in this direction .
0	coupez-moi , isidor , vite ! coupez-moi !
0	any yet , it was really nothing at all .
0	i know better , sir . they do not come here to see me . nora is the attraction , and i have sense enough to know it . my nose is quite out of joint , he laughed , and tried to turn it into a compliment to his mistress . but she would have none of it .
0	prayers , it hath been sixty years since i heard those canting puritans , my mother and father , pray . i want no prayers . but come , i must put you in ward . there should be strong-rooms in this castle .
0	how do you do , miss vernon ? i am happy to see you looking so well . what truth in the report , eh ? the dance being over , lord erpingham led constance to a seat close by lady margaret midgecombe . the duchess had formed her plan of attack ; and , rising as she saw constance within reach , approached her with an air that affected civility .
0	no , polly took that away from me .
0	your face looks the way mine must have , over three thousand years ago ! there was a long , taut silence .
0	a lie ! a lie ! " your name is signed to a contract with j.d. telfer , mayor of gulf city , miss . , calling for 3,000 shares in the gulf city land company , and -- "
0	mr perkins , i must have a man as lookout at the foremast-head , if you please . you had better bend a boatswain 's chair on to the gaff-topsail halyards , and send him up in that , as i shall require him to stay there until we are safely at anchor . and when you have done that , rouse your cable on deck , and see everything ready for letting go . jack , i can spare eyes for nothing but the ship just now , so oblige me , will you , by taking the glasses , and say whether you can see anything in the shape of a boat coming toward us with a flag flying . and , between whiles , you may just look carefully along the coast to see if you can spot a guarda-costa hovering about . we do not want to be caught napping in the act of landing this stuff .
0	now for some real work , sometimes , walter , i feel that i ought to give up this outside activity and devote myself entirely to research . it is so much more important .
0	what do you want ? stiffening in himself the masculine but mirthless courage of the atheist , he drew a little nearer to the wall and , catching the man at a slightly different angle of the evening light , could see his face and figure quite plain . two facts about him stood out in the picked colours of some piratical schoolboy 's story . the first was that his lean brown body was bare to the belt of his loose white trousers ; the other that through hygiene , affectation , or whatever other cause , he had a scarlet handkerchief tied tightly but somewhat aslant across his brow . after these two facts had become emphatic , others appeared sufficiently important . one was that under the scarlet rag the hair was plentiful , but white as with the last snows of mortality . another was that under the mop of white and senile hair the face was strong , handsome , and smiling , with a well-cut profile and a long cloven chin . the length of this lower part of the face and the strange cleft in it ( which gave the man , in quite another sense from the common one , a double chin ) faintly spoilt the claim of the face to absolute regularity , but it greatly assisted it in wearing the expression of half-smiling and half-sneering arrogance with which it was staring at all the stones , all the flowers , but especially at the solitary man .
0	because your face is white , " why , black man " ?

0	yes , they , at least , are genuine , the prince was most indignant at having to remove them . my heart bled for him -- but there was no other way . beyond a little tightness across the shoulders , and a little looseness about the waist , they do very well .
0	yes , you old woman , and i ' m all ready for breakfast . are you ?
0	do you see that hill away over there in the east ? that 's blakeley 's hill . that 's miles away . we came from there in a bee-line . do you think that we let anything stand in our way ? we ' re -- we ' re -- invincible . houses -- we go right through them . even the movie people followed us , so now you can tell . rivers -- do you think that river stopped us ? do you know what the points of the compass are ? we came straight west , just as straight as an arrow . now we ' re going up on that ridge , where that big tree is . if you want to follow us , you can . then you can see just how we do it . you will see us -- you will see us go right through houses . i ' m not blaming girls that they do not have adventures --
0	it is , mademoiselle , and it is a happy event that , by seeing us unexpectedly , your memory has returned . but the reason mr . henfrey is here is to resume that conversation which was so suddenly interrupted at the villa amette .
0	make it worth my while and i will take her off your hands , " well , it 's none of my business , i reckon ; she will have to look out for herself , she 's nothing to me but a pest sand a nuisance -- i have been more bothered since she came back than i have been in years ! i ' d give a good deal to be rid of her , " said ware , greatly depressed as he recalled the extraordinary demands betty had made .
0	saveria ! saveria ! open the door , in the devil 's name !
0	is all right there , master richard ? " open " ! cried my grandfather suddenly and loudly . but the door remained fast .
0	i had not thought of that . it would help some , would not it ? " after me the deluge ! i know the kind . why not make yourself a sort of vicarious atonement " ?
0	then maybe you will pass on some more of your information , and tell me why some of the skins are tanned in quebracho and some in chrome .
0	hurry ! meanwhile , the police were having great difficulty with the steelbolt-studded door into the room . still , it was yielding a bit .
0	that was like a camp-meeting or an election row , " we would be in bad shape , " said richard hunt , as the bullets whistled high overhead , " if we were in the tops of these trees instead of behind them " . there had been no maneuvering , no command given among the confederates . each man fought his own fight . in ten minutes a horse-holder ran up from the rear , breathless , and announced that the yankees were flanking . every man withdrew , straightway , after his own fashion , and in his own time . one man was wounded and several were shot through the clothes .
0	no , not at all , he 's just playing it his way , not anyone elses . c ' mon , now , you know that .
0	as if i had such things ! " high heavy shoes , " said leslie , " short stout skirts " .
0	the increase of the drug traffic and the failure of the police to cope with it had led to the institution of a home office inquiry , you see . it was suspected that the traffic was in the hands of orientals , and in looking about for a confidential agent to make certain inquiries my name cropped up . i was at that time employed by the foreign office , but lord wrexborough borrowed me . every facility was offered to me , as you know . and that my investigations led me to the same conclusion as your own , my presence as lessee of this room , in the person of john smiles , seaman , sufficiently demonstrates .
0	that 's because they can not get anybody to go in the class with them , " good night , " i said , " do not make me laugh . you mean a second-_class_ scout . of course there are slightly used scouts , 1915 models , but you would not call them exactly second-hand . first comes the tenderfoot , then the second-class scout and then the first-class scout -- and above that are the silver foxes in a class by themselves " .
0	oh , ho ! _this_ is spain ! she chose the handle of a red tea cup and a little chunk of yellow crockery . she stared and stared at them . but all the time it was as though her eyes did not see them . all the time it was as though she was looking at something very far away . then all of a sudden she began to jingle them together in her hand , -- the little piece of red china and the chunk of yellow bowl ! and swing her shoulders ! and stamp her foot ! it looked like dancing . it sounded like clappers .
0	is he dead ? gentle reader , i have been through many scenes in my life , and have been many times where it was not the toss of a copper whether death or life was my portion , and i had some nerve to help me through , but i never was in a place that tried me like that one . i had been captured by the father of this little child , the husband of this beautiful , proud woman , the son of this charming old lady . i had seen him brought in , dead , had seen him buried , and had thrown a bunch of roses in his grave . now i was surrounded by these mourners , mourners when they should know the worst . cold chills run all over me , and cold perspiration was on my brow .
0	ha , ha ! it 's eroshka now , " and this is my son -- my own son -- whom i -- oh , gracious heaven ! eropegoff -- eroshka eropegoff did not exist " !
0	that 's a question i cannot pretend to answer . but i suppose that if people reject the truth , and yet want to believe something beyond mere physical facts , they can invent anything , that is if they happen to be endowed with sufficient imagination . " why do people believe such extraordinary things " ? she demanded almost wrathfully .
0	no ! " i shall tell him exactly what i saw , -- and ada . i saw , -- we saw , -- that when the news came about the flood , you were conscious of it all . if you will go to father and tell him the truth he will be but very little angry with you . i do not suppose you had a hand in it yourself " .
0	and what sort of end will it be ? " this will have an end . then call me . i will come . now , good-bye " .
0	all right , mansy dear , i ' m coming , safe and sound , mansy .
0	i sail before sunrise , " drop it " !
0	it is enough , you are my old and very dear friend , cio-cio-san . you have to-night added greatly to the debt of gratitude which i owe you and can never repay . but why did you come ? and why , most of all , are you in disguise ? why are you in russia at all ? why not in your beloved japan ?
0	strangers seem to have taken matters in their own hands for once we have made up our minds to stay , phil , even if we have to stand .
0	slim 's got him , hurry , captain , right off this way to the shore . slim must have him . listen to slim 's bellow .
0	bravo , hawke ! go it , boys ! at his heels a company had arrived with a heartening roar , and jumped down on to the crowded mass in the trench below them , a perfect forest of arms going up as the demoralised runaways bellowed for mercy .
0	that 's our silver spider ! it 's the ancient mascot of the romanelli .
0	he said to go ' straight up ' ! " the -- " ?
0	i ' d like to see him marry little anne . " why for his sake " ?
0	dash your blanked impudence . to havana , and be hanged to you . anything more you want to know ? and my name 's lumsden , and i am sixty years old , and if i had you here , i would put a head on you for getting in my way , you -- " where are you bound to " ? hailed o ' brien 's voice again .
0	do not say ' it ' -- my boat is a lady -- speak of her as such , yes , i think she will be safe . but i will see if there is a dock watchman , and if there is i will engage him .
0	it was a close call , he 's got to give us a dinner for helping him out of this .
0	keep down ! they ' re going to --
0	not less , at least , you give me credit for no more wit than yourself . do you think that i am the man to do things by halves ? i have betrayed the plot to albemarle ; but do you imagine i have made no provision for what must follow ?
0	of course you ' d have some poor , unfortunate pup , or kitten , to mother , ruth fielding , " you come and see jane ann -- and be nice to her . she does not look it , but she 's just as scared as she can be " .
0	me to leave the house ! me to go to prison !
0	which , of course , i will not accept , " i did not exactly know you would be discharged this morning , but i had an idea you would be discharged at some time or other . that is why i came with my offer " .
0	unfortunate ! was not it more unfortunate for us to be making a meal for a few million ants ? i ' m darned glad rolfe attacked , and i do not understand your message telling him to hold off .
0	you might as well say that it does no good to the people who have to walk to-day , or travel by trains and motors , to know that in a hundred years the common method of getting about will probably be by flying . this writer lays it down as a principle that there 's a rate for human progress , and that it 's no use expecting man to get on faster than he has the power to go . " what i complain of in all this , " thor said , tossing the book on the table , " is the intermediary suffering . it does no good to the starving of to-day to know that in another thousand years men will have so grasped the principles of christ that want will be abolished " .
0	i have half a mind to give him a chance , " he sure would kill the ball if he ever caught it on the end of his bat , " declared red curry .
0	ha ! ha ! i should say that it was a very fortunate coincidence , and it shows that i made a wise choice when i selected you to take miss kerby 's place . i did not know who else to call upon -- of course i could not go out into the audience to find some one , and thus betray my predicament to everybody ; neither could i take one of the housemaids , because she would have been sure to blunder and be so awkward . oh ! is not this dress just lovely ?
0	do not let him take you down the rapid , there 's no good place for landin ' him there . hold on , an ' bring ' im up if you can . hi !

0	who says he 's been cleared ? he 's still a suspect .
0	question him ! the boy at this moment appeared by his side .
0	but you do not give her her christian name , " i have been helping evening star arrange her house . she is anxious to be like a frenchwoman , and has put off many indian ways since she became a convert " .
0	' tis i where i sit , thou offensive monkey ! ' then the monkey affected eagerness , and gazed about him , and peered on this beast and on that , exclaiming like one that 's injured and under slight , " what 's this i have done , and wherein have i offended , that he should be hidden from me when pointed out " ?
0	yes . and a clergyman 's daughter , " six years in her last place " ? said daphne shakily
0	then there is little doubt what your grace 's decision will be , to speak truth , it was the fear of your consulting her that made me bring you here . what say you to a ride in the forest to-morrow night ?
0	ah ! that 's it ! that funny little twist of the head you always had , like a -- like a -- well , you know i must have told you a thousand times that it was like a nice friendly puppy ; so why should not i say so now ? and your eyebrows ! when you look like that , nobody could ever forget you , joe !

0	can you cook a herring ? i came down to earth with a bang . stunned i stared at him . i distinctly remember wondering where i was .
0	glory ! hear that , would ye ? sure he looks it , too , by the same token . but it will nade the hull caboodle of us to lift buster aboard , for what wid all the wather he 's gulped down he must weigh a ton , so he do .
0	you will not be able to indulge in all your mad schemes , but there will be enough to help on a few . and you will be among friends . arthur told me he had explained it to you and that you had agreed .
0	does that gor-righteously fool ahead there think i blowed three whistles to salute marston 's birthday or their last dividend , mr . mayo ? sez all the little fishes that swim to and fro , she 's the liverpool packet -- o lord let her go !
0	as a point of honour , i think you ought to breakfast . a la bonne heure , monsieur le chevalier ! the little man shook his head dubiously . " but , as a point of honour , i really think -- "
0	no ! on upper fifth avenue . it 's situated in the extreme southwest corner of the men 's cafe at the holland house . it consists of a round mahogany table and a leather settee .
0	all right . go to sleep now , or you will all over-sleep , " yes , we want to be up and ready to start when gilly comes for us , " added joan , the corporal .
0	what am i , an idiot ? i had to know .
0	careful , there ! that is not a low baluster you ' re sliding down .
0	to the devil with you . upon which loveday in a middle pew , perceiving here something sinister , like a still wind flew to a back door , before ever the amazement of the people had given place to a flutter like leafage ; and running fast , he came up with hogarth by a stile twenty yards behind the chapel , touched his shoulder .
0	then i ' m with you , nellie ! " no , " said nellie , looking at him queerly . " fairfax will not care . you can be sure of that " .
0	i seem to have a faculty for doing that . i do for others what i can not do for myself . " what you did for maisie . how did you put it last night ? you have led them to their kingdom " .
0	so they tell me , " and you have come to stay " ? his highness , all delight and confusion , contrived to stammer .

0	ear-rings ? my taste has improved , perhaps .
0	oh , shut up , galusha ! do not be so confoundedly absurd . you are one of the cleverest men in the world in your line . you are distinguished . you are brilliant . if you were as queer as dick 's hatband -- whatever that is -- it would make no difference ; you have a right to be . and when you tell me that a woman -- yes , almost any woman , to say nothing of one lost down here in these sand-hills -- would not marry you in a minute , you ' re worse than queer -- you ' re crazy , absolutely crazy .
0	that will be two weeks from now , i have a ship of my own in ferrok-shahn . it lies there waiting now , manned and armed . i am hoping that , with dean 's help , we may be able to flash them a signal . it will join us on the moon . fear not for the danger , haljan . i have great interests allied with me in this thing . plenty of money . we have planned carefully .
0	wo not you have my chair , sir ? " good , harry i ' m with you there , " said voice behind him , and looking around , we saw mr . wood standing in the doorway , gazing down proudly at his step-son .
0	but you can not prevent me . i ' m sixteen and a half , ' obstinate as a mule , ' as mrs . lynde once told me , oh , marilla , do not you go pitying me . i do not like to be pitied , and there is no need for it . i ' m heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear green gables . nobody could love it as you and i do -- so we must keep it .
0	my time has come ! my time has come ! in the dream , jan bounded away through the crisp , biting air , his big paws sinking in the cold , fluffy snow . oh , how good it felt !
0	oh , screws , and nuts , and hammers , and things . but i do not make trains , old fellow ; i ' m just making the survey !
0	crazy child ! why , your things always smell of orris ; is it a penance ? " a sachet . a little blue silk bag of orris-root powder . there was a whole counterful of them , marked down to fifty cents . i ' d never seen any before , and they seemed irresistible . i took one up and wandered about the store with it . nobody seemed to notice , so i carried it off " .
0	down helm ; back fore-top-sails ! lower away the boat there !
0	but that is all . we have brought you warning , and our plea . can you help us ? " rockets , " grinned morey . " our first ship was part rocket " .
0	charles is a very excellent young man , and i am sure loves me deeply , but then any one can see he loves himself extravagantly .
0	is not this fun ! " all aboard " ! cried ted , as he and jan took their places in the first boat . " all aboard " !
0	you have got keen eyes , my friend , " i reckon that you have forgot that your horse has got a brand on him " ?
0	for god 's sake , spit it out , and have done with it ! what 's the boy done ?
0	it would not have been worth the money , sir ; the chain was not real gold . " why did not he take the chain to the jeweler 's to be fixed " ? asked the commissioner .
0	my goodness ! dispossessed -- and without breakfast !
0	you are infinitely practical , katherine . ( i am going to call you katherine for the next few minutes . because i think of you as katherine , i love to speak your name to yourself ; it seems to bring me a little nearer to you ) . listen to me . do not you think you could endure me as a husband ? i am a better fellow than i seem , and mine is no foolish boy 's fancy . i am a better man when i am near you . then this old cousin of mine will leave me all he possesses if you are my wife , and the baroness de burgh , with money enough to keep her place among her peers , would have no mean position ; nor is a husband passionately devoted to you unworthy of consideration . " you make me terribly sad , mr . de burgh , " she said , with trembling lips . " you make me _so_ sorry that i cannot marry you ; but i cannot -- indeed i cannot . will lord de burgh not pay your debts if he knows you have done your best to persuade me to marry you " ?
0	guard her , and if she gets away this time , i will shoot you .
0	but i was only exclaiming because it was not twice as much , " that 's my joke , " said goodman .
0	now , you yellow-liver , you show the white feather ! you ' re flitting about like a grasshopper . off with you , my boy ! you ' re in for it ! if you do not get out right away you will be feeling a palm 's length of steel in your ribs !
0	oh no , it 's nothing that anyone can help . it 's myself . please do not bother about it . i believe if you will excuse me , and make my excuses to the ladies in there , i will go . i really have some work to do . " i noticed that you seemed troubled . can i help you in any way ? is it the church " ? she asked gently .
0	the loup garou , i think nothing would dare harm her . but i should like my sister to see her . oh , i am sure you will like her , even if she is a woman grown .
0	i do not know , i do not know . we ' re all gone to hell ; looks like the last smash . there are no more supporting orders -- something 's gone wrong . gretry has not sent any word .
0	we will resort to arbitration , " but i want attorneys who are willing to help me . it will not be a help if you decline to accept my money " .
0	mr . sagittarius ! where is he ?
0	i will ; but it is not dangerous , madeline is spending the evening with me to-morrow .
0	fine ! fine , my story is not growing like that though let me tell you . this story is true . it 's a complete narrative of truthful john . i was about to turn back and make inquiries when i could get an express train for albany , when what should i see coming up to the dock but the varmint ii . as soon as the people on board saw me they immediately began to urge me to come with them . they had seen the growler just pulling out and leaving me in my unfortunate plight .
0	i think i ' m quite safe , for the brigands are generally very chivalrous to women , and only run away with gentlemen and chop off their fingers ! " and i shall be frightened of every man who does not carry a big red or green umbrella " ! declared dulcie , hanging on to the arm which douglas gallantly offered for her protection . " what do you think about it , carmel " ?
0	you ai not seen nothing finer in all your travels , mrs . dow must have heard us tramping up the snowy steps of the church , for she met us at the door . every one had gone except the old ladies . a kerosene lamp flickered over the sunday-school chart , with the lesson-picture of the wise men , and the little barrel-stove threw out a deep glow over the three white heads that bent above the baby . there the three friends sat , patting him , and smoothing his dress , and playing with his hands , which made theirs look so brown .
0	i do not do things that way , barbi . " you are crying , liebes fraulein ! think yet again , perhaps it is not quite all settled ; it is not possible that a maiden should not a way out leave " ?
0	here ! look out what you are about ! look where you ' re hitting , can not you ?
0	i wish a big whale would come along and tow me , i would not let him go loose .
0	that was fine , young man ! if you had not won that race i think i should have cut you off in my will . i have got a reward here for sam , too , and you tell him not to leave before he has seen me .
0	i will make him pay for this ! o ' meara cleared his throat and began gingerly to undo the handkerchief on his hand . then he brought his fist down on the table so that the ink started from the stand and his cheeks shook with the effort .
0	oh , what a dreadful accident ! " i will call uncle toby " ! exclaimed lola .
0	that is true ! i wonder why we always leave the mother out of the count when we sum up the hereditary tendencies ? i suppose the mother is as much a parent as the father . " yes , and she had a mother as well as this father of hers . why should not she be like her mother " ?
0	ho ! he 's running ! i made him run !
0	just go through the gate right there , i ' m sure he will be glad to see you . should not your pet be on a leash , though ? keep him out of the flowers . and do not let him chase my cat . she will claw him good if he does .
0	come in ! there was no reply to this . at the time he had mentioned ; mallard walked about his room in impatience . just before three o ' clock , his ear caught a footstep outside , and a knock at the door followed .
0	never mind , briggs , it 's all right . i ' d forgotten i had a guest coming ; that 's all .
0	why , girls , we do not know what half of them are for , and magic it seemed to the girls as they wandered from one thing to another . the electrical appliances in the dressing room !
0	wow ! nothing to it ! on the first play the ball went to gordon , the heavy full back , who plowed through the right side of bartlett 's line for eight yards .
0	yes , by h -- l , we are now satisfied .
0	that 's nothing new . there are plenty of them around here , " i forgot to tell you , " said larue in a low voice , " that some of the men report having encountered indians during the day " .
0	well , i should say so -- an ' away up in a tree , an ' in the funniest little baskets you ever saw . an ' some of the eggs is white , an ' some blue , and some green , an ' some speckled an ' oh , so many kind . but i will tell you a thing right now that will help you to remember -- mighty nigh every bird lays a egg that 's mighty nigh like the bird herself . the cat bird 's eggs is sorter blue -- an ' the wood-pecker 's is white , like his wing , an ' the thrasher 's is mottled like his breast . shiloh 's eyes opened wide : " why , do they lay eggs , archie b . real eggs like a hen or a duck " ?
0	yes , zeus is a long way from the great hero of the legends , is not he ? using the old calendar , zeus died in about 1100 b.c. , not too long after the close of the trojan war . as far as anybody knows , neptune did the actual killing , but it 's pretty clear that the original idea was not his . he thought the list of gods over . " zeus , " he said .
0	i ' m actually glad we came ! this is fun galore .
0	i have always heard that greeks do not like italians , charley came forward to board the prize , but when i proceeded to haul alongside by means of the line , the italians cast it off . we at once began drifting to leeward , while they got out two pairs of oars and rowed their light craft directly into the wind . this manoeuvre for the moment disconcerted us , for in our large and heavily loaded boat we could not hope to catch them with the oars . but our prisoner came unexpectedly to our aid . his black eyes were flashing eagerly , and his face was flushed with suppressed excitement , as he dropped the centre-board , sprang forward with a single leap , and put up the sail .
0	not at all well , i do not understand the people here . i will get you to take me round before i do another thing . it is so different from england . are you sure my clothes are all right ?
0	then some one has been giving me the roasting that i plainly deserve ? " oh , nonsense " . retorted miss bentley , flushing . " it 's nothing at all , especially coming from such a source " .
0	come about in a circle then and head back ! every second they were approaching where the germans had made a stand .
0	not that it makes any difference , but why ?
0	i am sure it will be agreeable to us , tell us something about your voyage . did you have a nice time ?
0	go your way in peace ! i can do nothing for you . ' tis but a few miles to gamewell , if you know the road .
0	i ' m afraid i have rather a faculty for letting things worry me , if one did not always have to work against time , at high pressure --
0	is not that like father ? and he has sat here so meekly all day . well , i will not pout . i ' m glad you came . he does not have very many good times now any more . there are so few of his kind left . the second generation are a tame lot . nils looked at clara , who sat frigidly with her white skirts drawn tight about her . " he did not tell you he had asked me to come , did he ? he wanted a party and proceeded to arrange it . is not he fun ? do not be cross ; let 's give him a good time " .
0	that 's nice . i ' m glad for you two boys to have a good time . mr . ernest 's a nice boy ; i always liked him first rate . he 's a little feller , though . he ai not big like you , is he ? i guess he ai not as tall as mr . ralph , even . " oh , no ! he 's awful busy this summer . i saw him in town yesterday . we went to the circus together " .
0	i do not want to hear mr . fellingham 's comparisons , van diemen strode round the drawing-room with his hands in his pockets . " there 's a disparity of ages , " he said , abruptly , as if desirous to pour out his lesson while he remembered it . " a man upwards of forty marries a girl under twenty , he 's over sixty before she 's forty ; he 's decaying when she 's only mellow . i ought never to have struck you , i know . and you ' re such an infernal bad temper at times , and age does not improve that , they say ; and she 's been educated tip-top . she 's sharp on grammar , and a man may not like that much when he 's a husband . see her , if you must . but she does not take to the idea ; there 's the truth . disparity of ages and unsuitableness of dispositions -- what was it fellingham said ? -- like two barrel-organs grinding different tunes all day in a house " .
0	what does this delay mean ? put him down at once and lay the lashes on !
0	that is true . pardon me . i was only anxious to show how strong my conviction was against any such easy explanation of a crime marked by such contradictory features . " you forget my cloth , " said he .
0	you used to say we lived on love . " yes , but then we were always dreaming of the day when i ' d make a lot ; we lived on that hope , did not we " ?
0	no , no ! now , back ; farther , farther . i do not like the idea of having my back to the door .
0	you liar ! a gasp came from the company . never in the history of the club had anything like that happened .
0	so much the better , " it is as good as if i had the money already in my pocket . besides , the racket is rather cheap , for the little one is a picture " .
0	why , no ; but you ' re looking quieter -- smoothed out , " you did not know me ? i ' m so changed " ? granice faltered , feeling the rebound of the other 's wonder .
0	burned alive ! what a pity we missed so interesting an experiment ! how i should have liked to find out how it felt !
0	you ass ! have not i done all the work ? do not i get --
0	both of you have hit the nail on the head , for that is what the indian wants to say . and here at the five mile station the party of hostiles appear to have separated , the tall man and the one who is groggy , together with the dog , going off toward the east ; while the others keep on straight . and you can see that our friend chooses to follow the three , for some reason of his own .
0	aha ! my showman again , eh ?
0	why , it was not such a very ironclad engagement as all that , alice . they said they were going to drive out to cambridge over the milldam , and i said i was going out there to get some of my traps together , and they could pick me up at the art museum if they liked . besides , how could i explain ? " yes , " she persisted ; " and we must do them . you must go to those ladies you disappointed so this morning , and apologise -- explain " .
0	ho , ho , ho ! the remaining indians in the water had discovered their mistake , and were making towards the opposite shore with all possible haste . they had not expected such a reception , and appeared to be glad to escape with no greater loss .
0	to take the responsibility . she turned upon him and surveyed his face with a curious scrutiny . " well " ?
0	you come to-morrow night , eh ? " you think i ' m a kid " ? flared pete . " if was dark when i come over here and it ai not any darker now . i ai not no doggone cow-puncher what 's got to git on a hoss afore he dast go anywhere " .
0	mrs . gray ! two men came running over the rocks .
0	they may say what they like -- i care not ! " donald , " she said , " men call you a man of blood ; they say that your hand is red and your soul black with crime " !
0	oh , we are not desperate , you forget i am bred to this life , and have been alone in the wilderness without arms before . the woods are full of game , and it is not difficult to construct traps , and the waters are filled with fish which i will devise some means of catching . you are not afraid to be left alone ?
0	runkle , we are fond of the englishmen . their commanding officer called for our best speed , and we ' re going to show it .
0	a fine compliment to me , cousin ruth , " i do not call it teasing . floyd wants to spoon , " declared ruth , emphatically . " he ' d run after any woman " .
0	go ! the race was from a dead start . the girls bent forward , their left feet upon the mark .
0	you unalloyed imbecile , at least have the prudence if not the intelligence or courtesy to be silent while your betters are speaking . gootes was a bloody knave , a lazy , slipshod , slack , tasteless , absurd , fawning , thieving , conniving sloven , but even if he had the energy to make the attempt and a mind to put to it , he could not , in ten lifetimes , become the perfect , immaculate and prototypical idiot you were born .
0	quiet ! they ' re entering .
0	merciful heaven ! are you demented , alexander ? do you realize what you are doing ?
0	very well , take the other court .
0	oh , come on ! come on ! do not be afraid ! he is just like jim , only a different color . they have men of all kinds of colors here in america . they are just like other people , all but the color . come on , rea . do not be silly . you can not half see from there !
0	we will stand no more of it ! we will go in there and see to it ourselves !
0	are you going to hurry and dress so we can go ? " i am losing the factory as well . i will have to sell out for a song . i can not compete with cutthroats -- "
0	where 's your prisoner ? i feared he ' d get you .
0	the king of beasts and thy king ! ' and the monkey cried , " who commandeth " ?
0	so the fine folks could not stomach the smell any longer ! yes , yes , i heard the news of that when i was lying ill down there in the darkness . at night , when the others came creeping in , they told me about it ; we laughed properly over that idea of yours . but ought not you to be at your meeting ? " the negotiations are proceeding ; yesterday we held the first meeting " .
0	i did put him , " you need not go to so much trouble . you will find that plot against my grandfather 's liberty fully described in some of the letters . the point that will be put to you by the cross-examining counsel is , if you thought him off his chump , why did you only pretend to put him in an asylum " ?
0	hurrah ! hurrah ! " hold on , sim ! you have hugged me enough for one day , " said i , shaking him off .
0	good god ! suppose he should come here ?
0	i will be a b.a. by then , and we will shake hands over our mutual success ! " you will see me a matron yet " ! she announced . " i warn you that i ' m ambitious , and mean to get on " !
0	flag uv truce held by the lady will not be shot at , purvided no one else comes with her . [ illustration : " snatching a walking stick from a bystander and tearing a sleeve from her dress , she made a flag of truce and mounted the steps of the gate " . ( 188-189 ) . ]
0	treason ! one passage in that first encounter in the virginia legislature has become deathless . hackneyed though it be , it can never grow old . referring to the injustice of the stamp act , patrick henry reached the climax of his speech in these words : " c sar had his brutus ; charles the first , his cromwell ; and george the third -- "
0	here , he 's not up there ; he 's in the river i tell you ! the pony leaped forward .
0	you are strong , and you move like a warrior . he sprang to his feet and pulled her up . the cross on her bosom swung and flashed . the top of her head came only to the middle of his chest , but he suspected that she weighed as much or more than he did .
0	no ! i should think not .
0	noah , i believe you ' d joke at your own funeral . " as the poet says , " noah ezekiel drew down the corners of his mouth , pulling a long face , " ai not life real " ?
0	no , you do not ! you fellows are dispossessed .
0	i do not suppose the people in the tenements are as poor as we are sometimes , tania , because they do not need so many things . but do not worry your head about me , little fairy godmother . i am sure that you will bring me good luck . " did you say that you did not have all the money you wanted " ? inquired tania anxiously . " i did not know that people like you ever needed money . i thought that all poor people lived in slums and took in washing like old sal " .
0	i think it broke one of its little fins , it hurt me much more than itself , because it would not be good and fly all the way .
0	he will have something interesting to report to his master then , " a spy sent by zat arrras , " he replied . " it was ever his way " .
0	oh , yes , no one can hear . we are quite alone .
0	ah ! the same lazy crowd and the same old story -- a horse trade ! " miss lucy , you see this here sorrel " ?
0	of the mayorunas more is known . they are eaters of human flesh , inhabiting both sides of the javary , deadly when angered , and very easily angered . their country is not many days distant from here , but as they never attack us we do not attack them . it is an armed neutrality , as you senhores would say . true , we have to be careful in drinking water , for they sometimes poison the streams against real or imaginary enemies , and the poisoned waters flow down to us , causing those who drink it to die of a fever like the typhoid . yet , there is a saying , is there not , that water is made not to drink , but to bathe in ?
0	i have not suddenly gone crazy , ernest , old fellow , ladies and gentlemen all , this little school-ma ' am was introduced to you as miss price , but that was a mistake . let me introduce her again as miss bertha seeley , my long-lost and newly-found sister .
0	can you tell me why chiefly ? i believe it absolutely myself , but i am afraid it is partly a sentimental belief . already i love them , and it makes me jealous for them . i feel i cannot bear anyone to throw doubt upon their antiquity .
0	you are very intelligent . nagendra babu is fortunate in possessing such a servant . i thought the talk about kunda nandini was a mere pretence . you came to inquire after haridasi _boisnavi_ . you came to know my design in wearing the _boisnavi_ garb ; why i went to the datta house : this you came to learn , and in part you accomplished your purpose . i do not seek to hide the matter . you did your master 's work , and have received your reward from him , no doubt . i have a commission for you ; do it , and i also will reward you . " i only came to see you " .
0	i do not know if you ' re nice or not . anyhow , i had the money ; i ' d been clerking for a time at the woolsworth store and they had given me a good job . why should not i send jake the money i did not know how to spend ? " i do not like to think of your going without things you probably wanted and ought to have had . we could have let the mine go and worked for somebody else " .
0	one may admire exquisite bric-a-brac without loving it . " monsieur , " she said , " is it possible that you have succumbed to the charms of madame the countess " ?
0	_eh bien ! _ there -- i forgive them ! ah , those _sacr _ musicians !
0	that 's all right to talk , " well , i sha not have any sympathy for them if they do lose their money , " spoke up grant , " at least if they lose it by betting on their boat . i do not believe in that thing myself . i do not want any money that i have not honestly earned " .
0	sandwich jane , sandwich jane ! that 's the name for her , boys .
0	i have taken this one , " why , i thought people were not permitted to take court records -- "
0	excellent . " we will announce that we ' re working together on strategic connectivity products from an engineering , marketing , sales , and customer service standpoint . we will reveal that you and i met , several months ago - and by the way , my executive staff and board are aware of today 's meeting - and you will explain icp 's election for wallaby joey ii systems as an alternative to your own portable computer , and that you will continue to support the older icp bp computer , as well as facilitate co-sales with our people for joey ii computers . and finally , once you begin the merger process , we will determine wallaby 's value , and you will follow up about a year later with the acquisition announcement " .
0	dear lord , dear lady , a company of cavaliers are galloping up the avenue , a-shouting like devils for the king .
0	halloo , dick ! decided to come home , have you ? hope you have had a pleasant visit .
0	mr . hilliard and i merely tried each other 's mettle this morning . i am to return at four . " well , rather " ! boyd agreed , with a desperate grimace .
0	well , i ' d be willing to wager pete knows what became of the baby mice , trim him up with flowers , chicken , and he will make a nice green grave for the dear departed .
0	let 's have a grand blow out and bury the hatchet with pomp and ceremony . we will have speeches from both classes , and a perfectly gorgeous feed afterwards . you break the news to your class and i will endeavor to get my naughty children under control once more . i believe some of them love me a little yet , " what is it " ? asked julia breathlessly .
0	fancy those two dames ' running over egypt ' ! i wonder if they will look up at the sphinx and knit , " so you may have patty 's place next winter , too , " she wrote . " maria and i are going to run over egypt . i want to see the sphinx once before i die " .
0	hitting him ! they ' re hammering him for fair . told you they might do it .
0	why , you stupid ! do not you know how to hold a skin yet ? what do you stand staring at me for ? it 's the skin you should look at , not me ! there , hold it like that , and do not move again !
0	oh , i say , come now ! oh , yes , i see -- of course , looking at it from their point of view . by jove , i dare say the beggars were right , you know ; all the same , -- do not you see , -- your people were poaching too .
0	what if you did not ? _you_ can talk now if you want to ! i ' m going home in five minutes , and i want some money before i go , too .
0	it 's yours , if gertrude had been frightened when she arrived , she was now in a panic of fear . her fear was such that it was certitude . she was not suspicious . she was convinced . she looked at martin in horror , and her heavy limbs shrank under the golden stream as though it were burning her .
0	keep out of this ! maggie 's going away and you can not stop her . d ' you think her father is going to let her stay down here any longer , where you can spout your preaching at her ! -- and you all the time a stool and a squealer !
0	we will kidnap the babies , and then they will just have to come , " i say , i hope the major would agree , " jim put in . " i know he 's horribly proud " .
0	that is all right , come and see me at my chambers this evening when the inquest is finished . perhaps by that time we may be able to determine our plan of action .
0	all aboard , lawry ! the lawyer protested that the attachment could not be removed till the debt had been paid , but the sheriff was willing to take the responsibility of releasing the boat .
0	aw , aw ! ' tes nearly as strong as the broth i do make , ed ' n et , then ? here , eli , put some milk in the pan , and het it for ' un . he was in the pillory yesterday , and he seed richard trezidder and neck trezidder and emily trezidder , and another maid , a very purty one . then ' ee runned away , and after that he got to granfer fraddam 's cave . make a good quart of eggiot for ' un , eli . that will be better ' n sperrits . he 's too waik for that .
0	that 's the fact , is not it ? " annie -- please " ! he pleaded .
0	we may as well call it that , " t-twenty dollars " ? he asked .
0	i ' m afraid miss harper would not let us do that , however much we might fidget , i should like to see her face if we suggested it . is miss thornton your governess ?
0	the cats , and to think i was born here an almost even third of a century ago ! but they were not nasty then . maybe because there were not any tourists . why , lee , i learned to swim right here on this beach in front of the outrigger . we used to come out with daddy for vacations and for week-ends and sort of camp out in a grass house that stood right where the outrigger ladies serve tea now . and centipedes fell out of the thatch on us , while we slept , and we all ate poi and opihis and raw aku , and nobody wore much of anything for the swimming and squidding , and there was no real road to town . i remember times of big rain when it was so flooded we had to go in by canoe , out through the reef and in by honolulu harbour .
0	no , those are the grandest ladies in the town -- the doctor 's wife , the burgomaster 's lady , and the inspector 's wife , and such like . " is it here " ? asked lasse , astounded . they had come to a great building like a barn , before which a number of people were standing . but it was fine inside . they sat right up at the top , at the back , where the seats were arranged like the side of a hill , and they had a view over the whole theater . down below , right in front , sat some ladies who , so far as lasse could see , were naked . " i suppose those are the performers " ? he inquired .
0	very good , my straightforward child , but look , there is the man ! here , good gibbus -- come here ! -- now , just consider : supposing you had flattered some one so grossly that you had offended him instead of pleasing him : how would you explain the state of affairs in telling me of it ?
0	how ' d you get so wise , chicken little ? " yes , sherm , but if you get thorns in your hand , it 's better to try to pull them out than to go on pushing them in deeper , is not it ? i know when i was a kid , it always helped a lot to have mother kiss it better " .
0	it pays so well that i have got to ride the traps again this winter to pay for the grub-stake . dad is so sore that he is not allowing me all he might . " must be money in staking a sky pilot , " grinned the postmaster . " i did not notice you taking up a collection on sunday , though " .
0	good news ! go on ! " what news , sir " ? asked the officer , evidently anxious to start a conversation .
0	it 's a success ! it 's a success ! the flying mermaid was indeed rising in the air . true it did not go up so swiftly as had the monarch , but then it was a much heavier and stronger vessel , and flying was only one of its accomplishments .
0	ha-ha ! pool , eh ? does nero play pool ?
0	i assure you i welcomed the opportunity . " and you have come alone " ? he drew up his ponderous form .
0	never mind landing at the town ! go directly out to the ship !
0	well -- no ! " well " ? said guerchard , and his voice shook .
0	my god ! who are you ? while jack blunt worked upon the lover 's fears , " prince djiddin 's " hands , on an exploring tour , drew out a knife and two revolvers from the captured burglar 's wideawake coat . he picked up the bulky bundle which the thief had dropped , and saw the bank seals of calcutta and the insurance labels thereon . " i will give you a show . keep silent " ! cried hardwicke as he cut the cords on the fellow 's legs . then grasping him by the neck , he dragged him bodily to the door of the " moonshee 's " room , where he thrust him in . then he locked the door , and knocking on his own , induced the frightened janet fairbarn to open at last . the poor woman screamed as " prince djiddin " calmly said : " go and rouse up the girls . send one of them to bring the gardener and his two men over here . i have got the thief locked up " .
0	it 's all very well for you to talk ! yours are safe enough !
0	do not go in front of the vent-hole ! there are prussians in the cellar !
0	if you put it in that way , i do not . no , if _we_ were on our honeymoon i could not tolerate a third , if it were an angel . but it seems as if every one must want you . " marie " ! mary echoed the name , her voice dwelling upon it caressingly . " marie ! that was the name of my -- not my best , but my second best friend at school . we were three maries . it will be good of your marie to call on me ; but she is a bride , and it 's still her honeymoon . do you think , if we -- that is -- "
0	that 's so ! " easily " ! cried westover . " it 's simply an instance of mental impression-of telepathy , as they call it " .
0	i should be sorry to have you do that ! but if i said what i was going to say , you might misunderstand . you might think -- i was asking for an invitation .
0	you ' re making me ashamed . i have not any wounds . i ought to have washed the blood off before i came in , but i did not have a chance . all i need is a basin of water and a towel . " you will let us doctor your wounds , will not you " ? moya asked shyly .
0	do not be childish in your old age , are you coming ?
0	you think so ? very well , i will come , but not for the sake of my face . what time is it ?
0	mary , mary , pay this young ruffian two months ' rent , and get the receipts from him , and if you ever let him in again -- i will -- i will kill you .
0	have i failed in politeness by not doing so ? i fear you would find me an insufferably dull companion . " why do not you ask me to go yourself " ? said violet audaciously .
0	let the morning stars -- freed from insult -- sing together ! the astronomer beamed like the rising sun .
0	you dry up ! who 's you ? mus ' be my lordship 's new shamwally making yourself so smart . reckon i will give evidence enough to fix you and my lordship out ! " she is giving in her evidence , " replied the counsel for the accused .
0	but i got that bottle in only the day before yesterday , and there 's hardly a drink left in it .
0	that is the time when i should begin not to feel sure of her , my anxieties would begin then . she is as changeable as an april sky . she could love passionately for a time , but for how long i should be sorry to guess . you see her in the studio , she is delighted with every fresh dress and fresh pose . never was there so good a model for a few days , then she gets tired of it , and wants something fresh . she is like a child with a new doll ; for a bit she will be wild over it ; she cannot sleep without it , she takes it with her everywhere , she adores it , but will it soon be thrown by , and perhaps she will be battering its head with a stick . when minette first came to the studio i was mad about her , now i would as soon have a tiger-cat for a mistress .
0	_what ! _ _married ? _
0	we want to shake hands , and to make sure that you have no hard feelings for what we tried to do to you .
0	they saw my diamonds at the drawing-room . mrs . vane burst into a laugh of mocking ridicule . " ' if people say anything ! ' " she repeated , in a tone according with the laugh . " they are not likely to ' say anything , ' but they will deem lord mount severn 's daughter unfortunately short of jewellery " .
0	go it , green ! jack wore a broad green belt and august had yellow . jack darted ahead !
0	i wish that was the hardest nut i had to crack , fortunately the door opens outwardly .
0	those burns i got , kept me awake . so i got up and was just walking around when the call came for somebody to drive one of these things . i took over .
0	it 's our rainbow , we saw it first .
0	she will learn ! she will learn -- in due time , there is but one thing possible . this whole pretended visit may be a sham -- she may even be the belle amie of this old curmudgeon .
0	you are quite right . i do not understand anything about it . he got angry . " i know what i am talking about . i only want to know how to set about it . you are quite stupid at times " .
0	we are wholly free from engagements in that line , sir , " good . we have plenty of room in the bachelor quarters , and no more cottages , at present , for married officers . so , gentlemen " -- here the major 's eyes twinkled merrily -- " you will be doing me an especial favor if you do not contemplate marriage for the present " .
0	ah , you have not ? that 's what i supposed you might mean . then , darling , what have you -- ?
0	very well , but to make perfectly sure of our safety , cross your fingers and spit .
0	look out ! go slowly , or we shall smash into the rocks .
0	his fatal modesty , " why -- why -- "
0	i paid especial attention to soups , sir , now , if mrs . anthony has done that you can live very economically .
0	i could not wait any longer , you have been out since daylight . you must be wet through .
0	by george -- he 's _got_ it ! what 's -- what 's the real word , hal ?
0	it 's gone ! it sank into the sand ! i saw it .
0	go along with ye ! she said this with unwavering cheerfulness ; but even the old miner lying in pain on the cot could realise the tragedy of a young girl 's having only one old dress in her love-hunting season . he looked at the young couple , and saw their evident interest in each other ; after the fashion of the old , he was disposed to help along the romance . " she may need some orange blossoms , " he ventured , feebly .
0	ha , ha ! this is logic with a vengeance !
0	i hope you have done a better job on the splicing than you did on your own rope when you sailed across the horseshoe bend , if you have not , i refuse to trust my precious life to your old rope .
0	the orders are , shoot every man in the saloon if necessary ! " what are the orders , constable cameron " ? enquired the sergeant in a loud voice .
0	they must not listen to our signals , one , two , three , four !
0	i guess so . i have lived in new york some years . but you and i are married , carnac , and you ought to take me to your home . " good night and good-bye , luzanne , " he said huskily . " you can get home alone , can not you " ?
0	down with the vampyre ! he dashed up the first staircase with surprising rapidity , leaving his pursuers behind ; and when he had gained the first landing , he turned upon those who pursued him , who could hardly follow him two abreast .
0	see the little rats ! they ' re full as they can stick now , and they want to go to bed . now , do not git up , mis ' haskins ; set right where you are an ' let me look after ' em . i know all about young ones , though i ' m all alone now . jane went an ' married last fall . but , as i tell council , it 's lucky we keep our health . set right there , mis ' haskins ; i will not have you stir a finger .
0	sally ! are ye goin ' to be all night with that there beer ?
0	known to me ! my own mother 's sister !
0	ideal ! what is ideal ? " yes , but the new illusions will not wear so well ; and in marriage you want illusions that will last . no ; you need not talk to me . it 's all very well , but it is not ideal " .
0	oh , heavens above ! what will -- what will become of me ! i ' d rather be dead , as i will soon be , than hear this , or know it at all . how could i get it ? i ' m as poor as poverty itself ! oh , could not you feel for the boy , an ' defend him on trust ; could not you feel for him ?
0	yes , yes , yes ! it is done ! it is done ! under the very nose of the cracksman , too ! merode 's got them both ! the little lordship and the mademoiselle lorne , too ! they took the bait like gudgeons ; they stepped into the automobile without a fear , and -- whizz ! it was off to the mill like that ! la , la , la ! we win , we win , we win !
0	you are fools , the lieutenant scowled and spoke in german to his superiors . after that the questions came fast , but neither o ' malley nor stan offered any further comment . they answered simply yes or no or refused to answer at all . finally the senior officer got up in disgust and stamped out .
0	agua ! agua ! " l ' eau " ! ejaculated the canadian .
0	body of satan ! there is a thoroughness about you , agustino . as a hermit you did not spare yourself ; and now as a tyrant you do not seem likely to spare others . " you are well-advised , " said i , when the rogue returned and handed me the ducats . " i told you i should come back to present my reckoning . be warned by this " .
0	yes , i know . that 's what i ' m expecting . that 's why i need a good lawyer to defend me . i understand you ' re the top man in this city . that stopped me for a moment . " you do not consider cheating illegal ? it certainly is in nevada . in new york , if you were caught at it , you ' d have the big gambling interests on your neck ; here , you will have both them _and_ the police after you . _and_ the district attorney 's office " .
0	you have run over a zouave ! the coachman of the private carriage threw the reins to the footman and sprang down to go to the horses ' heads .
0	i suppose you do not want me to ask any questions ? " leave everything to bosko , " said the general . " we must display no haste , and he will smooth the way through the customs " .
0	oh , i warned her ! but it was too late .
0	vine street , brisk .
0	but you need not associate with hollowell . we men cannot pick our companions in business and politics . it needs all sorts to keep the world going . " oh , i do not know . you need not laugh . it rather lets one down ; and it is not like you " .
0	i do not care . i ' d rather be with them than with you . i hate you , " you see " ? laughed dorrimore . " d ' you suppose i would set you down to be tossed and gored by vulgar cattle . why the sight of your red ribands would send them mad , as it 's nearly sent me " .
0	i have forgotten nothing ! oh , heaven ! oh , earth ! oh , waldemar ! that i could die ! that i could die ! " ' the wife of the duke of hereward ! ' have you then forgotten our betrothal at st . petersburg ? our flight from warsaw to st . vito ? our marriage at the little chapel of santa maria ? our short , blissful honeymoon in the vine-dresser 's cottage under the apennines " ? he inquired , bitterly .
0	you naughty , naughty , naughty boy , with the pigtail coiled inside of the lost shoe , mell ran on . she was passing a thicket of sassafras bushes , when a sound of crying met her ears . instantly she stopped , and , parting the bushes with her hands , peered in . there they were , sitting in a little circle close together , -- arabella and gabella sarah fast asleep , with their heads in belinda 's lap ; isaphine crying ; tommy sitting a little apart , an evil smile on his face , in his hand a pair of scissors !
0	you command like a great lady . ' must not , ' indeed , and ' presume ' ! let me tell you , pretty gabrielle , that i am the great lady here . gabrielle turned upon her friend with an air of dainty imperiousness . " flora , flora , you may be a witch , but there are some thoughts of mine you must not presume to read " .
0	my way is the safest , at any rate , on board this ship there are five rogues to each honest man .
0	_aiwah_ , effendi . just at this particular time , after all these thousands of years , the coincidence would indeed be strange .
0	it 's bob ! that 's a signal we used to have when we were hunting . it means ' come here ! '
0	no ; the odor of onions is a little strong , is not it ? rather strange , by the by , some of nature 's best restoratives should be rank and noisome , while her poisons , like the upas tree , are often sweet-smelling and agreeable ?
0	that 's a good idea , it has probably kept many a man on the straight path .
0	impossible ? what have you got that i have not got ?
0	now , i can spake , now i can spake . where 's my son ? where 's my son ? an ' what has happened me ? how did i come here ? was i mad ? am i mad ? but tell me , tell me first , where 's connor ? is it thrue ? is it all thrue ? or is it me that 's mad ?
0	we do , " no , i did not ; i said _this_ side , " replied the old sailor , laughing at the boy 's perplexity . " it is the right-hand side lookin ' for ' ad . do you understand it now " ?
0	give him ? our property , our homestead ?
0	oh , aunt virginia ! " well , my dear , they might be burglars , come to spy out the neighborhood , with the shop for a blind " .
0	get out of the way ! get out of the way ! tuttu darted across the street towards the stone where he had left the precious red bundle . there it was , lying unhurt , and he was about to seize it and carry it to a place of safety , when a fast-trotting horse with one of the light country gigs behind him , dashed down the street .
0	down with him ! " no , you leave me alone , idle young man , " he cried out at me at the top of his voice . i ran away . " messieurs , " he went on , " why this excitement , why the outcries of indignation i hear ? i have come forward with an olive branch . i bring you the last word , for in this business i have the last word -- and we shall be reconciled " .
0	here ! hold on ! what do you mean by that ? why should not i go into that house if i want to ? why should not i ?
0	i dinna think ye will break up on that , " oh , it ai not so much what a woman really spinds , " said jimmy , peevishly , as he shoved the money into his pocket , and pulled on his mittens . " it 's what you know she would spind if she had the chance " .
0	that is a slang term , mrs . henderson . what you want is nature , color , passion -- to pierce the artificialities . " then you would call yourself a realist " ?
0	let go ! the little fool ! does not he know enough to come in out of the wet ?
0	ah ! _non_ , i cannot . excuse me . my pronunciation is so faulty . your english is so ve-ry deefecult !
0	the curlo -- the inner curlo -- yes , yes ! poor fellows ! the inner curlo , dear , dear !
0	well , we have wasted more time than is worth while over this young , wild gosling , let us hope she will take our advice .
0	anyway , i feel like it , when i learned all these things i started right in to think . i thought like hell . i said to myself something like this : ' there 's nothing to hold me where i am . there 's no one around to care a curse . there 's that feeling right inside the pit of my stomach makes me feel i want to make good . i want to build up around me all that my birth has refused me . a name , a life circle , a power , a -- anyway , get right out and do things ! well , what was i going to do ? it needed thinking . then i hit the notion .
0	fire ! " fire " .
0	you gave us a little start , that 's all , of course , i knew what it was as soon as i saw the pontoons underneath . they seem to do the trick first rate , too . seems to me i ' d like to sail in one of those things , if i ever had the chance .
0	where away ? " hello " ! he cried . " what 's that ? a sail " ?
0	you do sum them up , do not you ? " oh , i do not mean that kind of talk . i did not know how much good i was going to get out of him at first . but he was the kind i had not known , and it seemed like he was part of the whole thing -- like the girls with title that ann said i must get next to . and an easy way of getting next to the man kind was to let him come and stay . he wanted to , all right . i guess that 's the way he lives when he 's down on his luck , getting invited to stay at places . like lady mallowe , " he added , quite without prejudice .
0	they ' re all words , words , idle words , " oh , bertram , is not it splendid ! i ' m so proud of you , " she whispered softly , when a moment 's lull gave her opportunity .
0	good night , boss , " hang it all , i thought you were turks . good night " .
0	i will win yet , my troubles are done with . i will shine like the sun ; i will rule like the sun , and my enemies shall whither beneath my power . it is a good omen . now i am glad that the roman spared my life , that in a day to come i may take his -- and miriam .
0	a week or two ago , allen wrote to some friends of his in winnipeg asking them to send me anybody . " you are doing this out of -- charity " !
0	we ' re taking ours now , good-bye , boys ; and thanks awfully for sending the telegram .
0	i do not mind at all , " i can try again , you mean ? i suppose i can do that . i think i will do that , as i can . and probably , if i turn out work that 's worth while , some day my chance will come . if i do not -- why , there are other things to do , and if you put your heart into them you can get happiness out of them . do you mind if i plagiarize a bit " ?
0	hold your tongue , will you ! i shall report you for this .

0	what is it , jack ? who are you shooting at ?
0	you would not , joel . you would not . for you never felt an overwhelming notion that you must dance in the moon upon the sand . you have never felt that , joel ; and -- i have . joel said slowly : " no . but i do not understand it " .
0	a penniless ' hearl , ' " well , jack had told me such heaps about you , you know , and he ' d hinted that , while we were having our great romance on a motor car , you were having one on toboggans and skates at davos , so i was interested . then i saw her at the ball , and we were introduced . she was pretty , but -- a prize white persian kitten is pretty ; also it has little claws . she liked you , of course , because you ' re young and good-looking . besides , her father was knighted only because he discovered a new microbe or something , while you ' re a ' hearl , ' as my new maid says " .
0	oh , you odd creature ! but , really , that man was the strangest , fascinating person --
0	why have not you brought her to sing for me ? " perhaps that is why they interest one . all the intelligence and talent in the world can not make a singer . the voice is a wild thing . it can not be bred in captivity . it is a sport , like the silver fox . it happens " .
0	oh that was not zenobie ; that was nature . and experience ! " zenobie was very sharp , " said pemberton . " and she made you so " .

0	oh , that texas cyclone is as wild as a range horse and is due to get potted any minute . in fact , he 's overdue . he 's a balloon busting fool , and no one can stop him . he has nine of them to his credit and every time he goes out he comes back with his plane in shreds and just barely holding together . you ' d think it would cure him , but he eats shrapnel . has two planes to his credit , but he does not go in for planes . he cuts formation exactly like you used to , shrimp , and goes off high , wide and lonesome , looking for sausages . he got one just this morning , and i give you my word his ship looked like a sieve when he came in . the major threatens to ground him if he does not quit cutting formation , but he 's only bluffing . he 's as proud as the rest of us . " what about -- yancey " ? he tried .
0	i often think of the overrun flower-pots in the cottages at dashwood , when trevannion has been adorning himself . i once mortally offended him by the same quotation . " ' i cannot talk with civet in the room -- a fine puss gentleman , that 's all perfume end_sentence_quote "

0	you will fall a victim to your own triumph , if you continue to attack with the same fervor , " now we will have something to fight with " ! cried glas jovially , tinkling a bottle with his knife .
0	hullo , young man ! this is a pretty business ! upon my soul ! your manner of entry into our commercial life is somewhat forceful ! what the deuce do you mean by all this ?
0	that 's better . you always were essentially reasonable , though somewhat impulsive for a man of your age . the rash way you severed our partnership , for instance . but enough of that . i think we ' d better leave immediately . into the sphere , please . you first , miss guinness . * * * * *
0	do not speak of the swine ! do not mention his name before me .
0	our friend , monsieur bragg , is faithful and wise ; but he drives like jehu . i have engaged him to transport us a part of the way . ruth shook her head and asked : " where are you taking me ? oh ! i thought charlie would have us over then " !
0	because you looked as though you would scold me . and of course all this tells upon his health .
0	no , no , john , speak more quietly .
0	tit for tat , pinocchio had nearly reached the top of the hill , and the man was halfway up , when a loud roar made them both stop . turning around , they saw that a lion was carrying off the dead ostrich . at that , the hunter thrust his fingers into his curly hair , and without paying further attention to the marionette , started off to regain the knife , which was still lying where it had fallen .
0	yes , she did ! she put the powder here ; she owns up to it .

0	i do not believe anne could leave becky and belinda , she would have to carry her family with her .

0	i should hate her if she was ! " did you think she was some young and lovely damsel who was eager to meet me again " ?
0	she will be a very rich heiress , " my heir is my cousin cecile here , " answered pons , insisting on the relationship . there was a flutter of admiration at this .

0	whose war is it ? the capitalists ' . you ' re fightin ' for morgan and rockefeller to save their investments and to help ' em to grind you into the dirt . england and france and america are all land-grabbers . they ' re no better ' n germany . the orator retorted : " this is war-times . we got to make ships to win the war " .
0	you ' d better not ! you have been very careless . i do not believe you watched carefully enough . when i came up just now you had your eyes shut .
0	you are at liberty to ask , " well , " replied jack calmly . " and now i wonder if you would explain a few things to me " ?
0	i daresay i shall take many a nap on it . you must make me a nice pillow-cushion , out of some of your bits of silk . mrs . french made a splendid addition to the room in a large oriental rug that doctor joe valued more highly as the years went on . for then we were getting bright-hued carpets from french and english looms , and these dull old things were not in any great favour . only it was so thick and soft , the little girl said it was good enough for a bed .
0	do not do that ! you should know better ! who was that gentleman ?
0	climb up ! climb up ! is not there some place -- some rocky ledge -- where you can find a footing ? the water 's getting deeper !
0	say doc , what about this super-female from texas , " new york is a grand town for a vacation , " george thought bitterly , as he parried the reporters ' persistent questions in the lobby of coloraudio system a week later .
0	ha , ha , ha ! that is a good one . no , mr . scarecrow is the policeman of the cornfield . let 's go over and set him on his pins again .
0	not a bit , the only criticism i ' d make is that you are really thrown away on the members of your very sedate club , heriot .
0	yes ; three , row to and fro , and see if you can make out a man swimming .
0	i do not think you ' re fair to yourself . mostly -- if you will forgive me -- i can tell a woman 's driving as far off as i can see the machine ; but you are a very fine driver . the way you brought that car in here impressed me considerably . " never had a chance to find out , " tish said grimly . " between nervous women in the machine and constables outside i have the twelve-miles-an- hour habit . i ' m going to exchange the speedometer for a vacuum bottle " .
0	both , best you have got , the railroad is paying for this .
0	and you do not feel alarmed at having a person of such violent opinions as your inspector at the head of your establishment , " the influence of the atmosphere on the condition of the labourer is a subject which deserves investigation , " said lady joan to mr jermyn , who stared and bowed .
0	sure , there 's no one interfering with what 's going on now .
0	how about fresh eggs and beefsteak ? " gentlemen , " remarked colonel howell , as he lifted a tin of steaming coffee , " here 's to a friend of civilization -- delicious coffee . we will know him but a few days longer . he will then give way to the copper kettle and tea " .

0	whiskey ! get him a glass of scotch !
0	most anything is likely to happen , now that you ' re a sophomore -- and a reporter , too .
0	well , you two below there , what do you make out ?
0	no , that does not suffice me , show me your passports if i am to believe that you are not vagabonds .
0	gus ! archie was no novice in the art of self-defence . since his early days at school he had learned much from leather-faced professors of the science . he had been watching this unpleasant young man 's eyes with close attention , and the latter could not have indicated his scheme of action more clearly if he had sent him a formal note . archie saw the swing all the way . he stepped nimbly aside , and the fist crashed against the wall . the young man fell back with a yelp of anguish .
0	now that you know each other , you can postpone getting chummy until later , mother will wonder what has happened to us . she will think you did not come on that train if we do not put in an appearance .
0	so you are going stag-hunting ? that 's purely , " i ' m not so sure of that , " answered the broom-squire , churlishly .
0	that 's a good plan . and a good day to do it in , too , " we might unpack a few things we need , and arrange the trunks so mine can be sent back home without giving you any trouble about yours , " suggested barbara .
0	here , burke , a little message from your best girl , i suppose , the day passed without more excitement than usual . bob took his turn after a short nap in the dormitory room of the station house . during his relief he rested up again . when he was preparing to start out again upon patrol a letter was handed him by the captain .
0	get your scare ! toot away once in a while . we do not want to stub our toe against some other craft , and that before we get out of the cove .
0	by jove ! there 's an idea truly worthy of my own nondescript brain ! we must surely have changed heads during that concussion ! no matter , there is some sense left in us yet . come now , captain , consider a little , if you can . were not we both half-killed by the shock ? did not i rescue you from certain death with these two hands ? do not you see barbican 's shoulder still bleeding by the violence of the shock ?
0	you ' re too modest , fairbanks , but we will boost fogg , just as he deserves . it 's been a hard , anxious run , i will warrant . we have got a relief crew coming , so you can get to bed just as soon as you like .
0	he did , he thought , he signed his name , and he supposed that was so well known that just to mention it would be enough . that 's why he kept it so secret while he was living on the mountain , you see , and that 's why even david himself did not know it . of course , if anybody found out who he was , that ended his scheme , and he knew it . so he supposed all he had to do at the last was to sign his name to that note , and everybody would know who he was , and david would at once be sent to his own people . ( there 's an aunt and some cousins , i believe ) . you see he did not reckon on nobody 's being able to read his name ! besides , being so ill , he probably was not quite sane , anyway .
0	do you realise who i am ? " not unless you make me , " douglas calmly replied . " now is your chance " .
0	they have caved ! we had fallen half asleep , my pony and i , as we went jogging and jogging through the long sunny afternoon . our hills of yesterday were a pale-blue coast sunk almost away behind us , and ahead our goal lay shining , a little island of houses in this quiet mid-ocean of sage-brush . for two hours it had looked as clear and near as now , rising into sight across the huge dead calm and sinking while we travelled our undulating , imperceptible miles . the train had come and gone invisibly , except for its slow pillar of smoke i had watched move westward against wyoming 's stainless sky . though i was still far off , the water-tank and other buildings stood out plain and complete to my eyes , like children 's blocks arranged and forgotten on the floor . so i rode along , hypnotized by the sameness of the lazy , splendid plain , and almost unaware of the distant rider , till , suddenly , he was close and hailing me .
0	a nice lot you are ! a nice lot to prate about law and order , and ready to do murder yourselves ! that is what you are preparing to do ! murder ! as cold-blooded a murder as ever man did !
0	oh , father ! make them stop ! oh , mr . carter , save us ! oh , they got poor francesca -- she 's locked up in your room ! they climbed up our porch , after they swore to harriet that they would not make another sound --

0	it will not be necessary . for , mark me , i do not intend to waste more time on you . answer me only this : when master pitt , as you pretend , came to summon you , did you know that he had been , as you have heard him confess , of monmouth 's following ? " i could bring others from bridgewater , who saw me set out that morning upon the crupper of master pitt 's horse " .
0	will you read it ! " bailiffs do not generally deal in warnings " .
0	just what i say , mother thought we ought to conduct you about the place and explain all the different phases of your new home , but i am inclined to believe you will like it better if you can make the tour all by yourselves . young folks usually glory in unexplored fields . now to it , for time is fleeting ! i shall call for a report of your discoveries at luncheon . a prize for the one who has seen the most .
0	annabel at last , where have you been ? all these hours i have been calling for you . annabel , i was lying . who says that i am not meysey hill ? i was trying to scare you . see , it is on my cards -- m . hill , meysey hill . do not touch the handle , annabel ! curse the thing , you have jammed it now . do you want to kill us both ? stop the thing . stop it !
0	ye say ye will not help the congress ? one day i was surprised to see the wagoner riding up the path to our cabin , crying out for my father , for he was a violent man . and a violent scene followed . they remained for a long time within the house , and when they came out the wagoner 's face was red with rage . my father , too , was angry , but no more talkative than usual .
0	i shall say i found you having a cosy t te- -t te with a young barrister of many inches and little brains , come , lorraine , spout away . what is your favourite hors d ' oeuvre ? did you feel like a boiled owl at your first appearance ? and which horse do you back for next year 's derby ?
0	the wreck ! the wreck ! " mr . pelham will have charge of the boat , " added captain kendall , who had great confidence in the zeal and ability of this officer .
0	i do not expect to hire any more staff . i presume there is already a complete organization , doubtless making money for me at this very moment . i will not interfere except when necessary , but i want a man like you to tell me when it is necessary . mr . jones ruminated . " i would not care to break with the firm , " he said at length . " there are family ties as well as those of business . a year 's leave of absence might be arranged . by that time you would be safe in your saddle . by the way , do you propose to hire all your staff by the same test " ?
0	they have naturally been watching both of you , and , in a general way , there 's only one decision they could have arrived at . " fallen out with him " ?

0	you ' d love like a lioness . i have subdued you outwardly , but within you are still primitive . delilah , discussing it with her artist , said : " leila makes me believe in romance with a big r . but i could not love like that " .

0	you are welcome if you can get them , but urania is not prodigal of her kisses , eugene ; i never was able to obtain a single one until she became my wife . but let us not speak of her . love is any thing but an incentive to valor ; and just now i almost envy you who have never loved . if you intend to be a soldier , twine no myrtle with your laurels until you shall have attained renown .

0	so was i , mother says cocky doodle is better than an alarm clock , for you do not have to wind him .
0	but you know it could not have been anything of the sort , for you fellows do not believe in ghosts .

0	ah ! you had better ask her yourself , mr . royle . she will , no doubt , tell you . of course , she will -- well , if you are to marry her . but there , i see that you are not quite responsible for your words this evening . it is , perhaps , natural in the circumstances ; therefore i will forgive you .

0	will you ex -- excuse me ? " i wrote mrs . bloodgood about my marriage " ? he said , slowly ; then as understanding dawned upon him the puzzled lines in his face loosened into laughter that would out . he leaned back in his rocker and gave himself up to it helplessly . as helplessly cornelia joined in . the doll on the sofa smiled on -- no more , no less .
0	you know what i mean , of course . take manti , for instance . or any new western town . the lowest elements of society are represented ; most of the people are very ignorant and criminal . " the four hundred would take exception to that " ! laughed rosalind .

0	wayfarers , look under the sun down the plain which lieth betwixt the mountains and the sea , and ye shall behold the meadows all gleaming with the spring lilies ; yet do we not call this the glittering plain , but cleveland by the sea . here men die when their hour comes , nor know i if the days of their life be long enough for the forgetting of sorrow ; for i am young and not yet a yokefellow of sorrow ; but this i know , that they are long enough for the doing of deeds that shall not die . and as for lord , i know not this word , for here dwell we , the sons of the raven , in good fellowship , with our wives that we have wedded , and our mothers who have borne us , and our sisters who serve us . again i bid you light down off your horses , and eat and drink , and be merry ; and depart when ye will , to seek what land ye will . " is this the land ? is this the land " ?

0	i wonder you ever made a mistake of any sort . i also wonder if you are a type as well as an individual ? i have , i think , followed intelligently your psychological involutions and convolutions so far . i am only hoping you will not get beyond my depth . what was your attitude toward your past mistakes -- beyond what you have told me ? did you suffer remorse , as i am told women do when they either voluntarily renounce or are permitted to sin no more ? " but to go back . after that was over i determined to put love definitely out of my life . i believed then and finally that i had not the gift of inspiring love ; nor would i ever risk humiliation and suffering again . i played the great game of life and politics . i was still beautiful -- for a few years -- i had an increasingly great position , all the advantages , obvious and subtle , that money could procure . my maid was very clever . my gowns , as time went on , were of a magnificent simplicity ; all frou-frous were renounced . i had no mind to invite the valuation i heard applied to certain american women in paris : ' elderly and dressy end_sentence_quote "

0	one thing we have to our comfort , that there may not lightly be found two sir godricks , and though his men be fell fighters , there where he is only shall his luck prevail to the full . now the maiden sat at table beside the lord and sir mark , and hearkened their talk , which at one time ran much upon that great captain of war whom they called sir godrick of longshaw . and she might see of both of them that they thought much of his wisdom , and not little of his luck , and feared him what he would do to them of the barons ' league , whereof were both those knights . and sir alwyn furthermore told the blue knight concerning tidings in the city of the sundering flood , and said that the king thereof was of little account before such a man as was sir godrick , for though he were well enough in a fray if the sword were put in his hand and the horse were between his knees , yet was he feathered-headed , stubborn in wrong , and hard-hearted . said sir alwyn , that save the said king was in all things according with the best men of the city , as the porte and the masters of the great crafts , he was undone . then he said again : " yea , and there is talk also how that the small crafts have in their hearts to rise against both porte and king , and certes if they may have sir godrick on their side , which is not wholly unlike , they will perchance come to their above ; and then again is the king 's cake but dough " .

0	come back to the bank instantly , you two ! " stop , you scoundrel , or i fire " ! he shouted , but the lieutenant had already disappeared . quick as thought the cashier darted into the passage , and without waiting to unfasten the low door which separated the public and private rooms of the bank , leaped over it , and , bareheaded , gave chase . a british naval officer in uniform , rapidly overtaking a young woman , quite unconscious of his approach , followed by an excited , bareheaded man with a revolver in his grasp , was a sight which would quickly have collected a crowd almost anywhere , but it happened to be the lunch hour , and the inhabitants of that famous summer resort were in-doors ; thus , fortunately , the street was deserted . the naval officer was there because the hour of the midday meal on board the cruiser did not coincide with lunch time on shore . the girl was there because it happened to be the only portion of the day when she could withdraw unobserved from the house in which she lived , during banking hours , to try her little agitating financial experiment . the cashier was there because the bank had no lunch hour , and because he had just witnessed the most suspicious circumstance that his constantly alert eye had ever beheld . calm and imperturbable as a bank cashier may appear to the outside public , he is a man under constant strain during business hours . each person with whom he is unacquainted that confronts him at his post is a possible robber who at any moment may attempt , either by violence or chicanery , to filch the treasure he guards . the happening of any event outside the usual routine at once arouses a cashier 's distrust , and this sudden flight of a stranger with money which did not belong to him quite justified the perturbation of the cashier . from that point onward , innocence of conduct or explanation so explicit as to satisfy any ordinary man , becomes evidence of more subtle guilt to the mind of a bank official . the ordinary citizen , seeing the lieutenant finally overtake and accost the hurrying girl , raise his cap , then pour into her outstretched hand the gold he had taken , would have known at once that here was an every-day exercise of natural politeness . not so the cashier . the farther he got from the bank , the more poignantly did he realize that these two in front , both strangers to him , had , by their combined action , lured him , pistol and all , away from his post during the dullest hour of the day . it was not the decamping with those few pieces of gold which now troubled him : it was fear of what might be going on behind him . he was positive that these two had acted in conjunction . the uniform worn by the man did not impose upon him . any thief could easily come by a uniform , and , as his mind glanced rapidly backwards over the various points of the scheme , he saw how effectual the plan was : first , the incredible remissness of the woman in leaving her gold on the counter ; second , the impetuous disappearance of the man with the money ; and , third , his own heedless plunge into the street after them . he saw the whole plot in a flash : he had literally leaped into the trap , and during his five or ten minutes ' absence , the accomplices of the pair might have overawed the unarmed clerks , and walked off with the treasure . his cash drawer was unlocked , and even the big safe stood wide open . surprise had as effectually lured him away as if he had been a country bumpkin . bitterly and breathlessly did he curse his own precipitancy . his duty was to guard the bank , yet it had not been the bank that was robbed , but , at best a careless woman who had failed to pick up her money . he held the check for it , and the loss , if any , was hers , not the bank 's , yet here he was , running bareheaded down the street like a fool , and now those two stood quite calmly together , he handing her the money , and thus spreading a mantle of innocence over the vile trick . but whatever was happening in the bank , he would secure two of the culprits at least . the two , quite oblivious of the danger that threatened them , were somewhat startled by a panting man , trembling with rage , bareheaded , and flourishing a deadly weapon , sweeping down upon them .
0	why did not you examine it closer ? suddenly , as something scuttled across the floor and disappeared into a hole in the wall , hale cried out and covered his eyes with a hand .

0	that is most sage advice , geoffrey , and worthy of my father-confessor ; but it is not so easy to follow . in the first place , i must tell you that i do not regard inez as in any way a step to fortune , but rather as a step towards a dungeon . it would be vastly better for us both if she were the daughter of some poor hidalgo like myself . i could settle down then with her , and plant vines and make wine , and sell what i do not drink myself . as it is , i have the chance of being put out of the way if it is discovered that inez and i are fond of each other ; and in the next place , if we do marry i shall have to get her safely out of the kingdom , or else she will have to pass the rest of her life in a convent , and i the rest of mine in a prison or in the galleys ; that is if i am not killed as soon as caught , which is by far the most likely result . obnoxious sons-in-law do not live long in spain . so you see , geoffrey , the prospect is a bad one altogether ; and if it were not that i dearly love inez , and that i am sure she will be unhappy with philip of sottomayor , i would give the whole thing up , and make love to the daughter of some comfortable citizen who would give me a corner of his house and a seat at his table for the rest of my days .

" yes , " went on the girl , her eyes as she leaned on her cousin 's shoulder resting on the deserted , weather-beaten building in the distance , " when i first came , my heart just yearned toward that old mill . it looked just as i felt . it had made up its mind never to forgive . i had made up my mind never to forgive . love has opened my locked shutters , and do you know , thinkright , some afternoons those closed mill blinds seem to be melting in the sun . they grow so soft and rosy , i watch them fascinated . it seems as if they were giving way and i find myself expecting to see them slowly turn back . oh , " impulsively , " i want them to turn back ! could not we get a ladder and row out there some day and climb up and open them " ?
0	the wish , indeed , arose in my heart , but i suppressed it manfully . do you not see , dear halber , that it would be unthankful and unknightly to reward in this cowardly and contemptible way the magnanimous confidence you have shown me . " thunder and lightning ! you have then seen my horses , " cried halber , thoroughly provoked . " did no wish arise in your heart to mount one and seek your liberty " ?

0	you are afraid of me . you are afraid to let me kiss you , because you are afraid of loving me . this afternoon -- here -- i all but kissed you . i mistook you for death . i was enamoured of death . i was a fool . that is what you are , you incomparable darling : you are a fool . you are afraid of life . i am not . i love life . i am going to live for you , do you hear ? she was too startled to move . " zuleika " ! he whispered . she was too angry to speak , but with a sudden twist she freed her wrists and darted back .

0	we grew up together , went to the same grade school and high school . it seems like there was never a time when alice and i did not know each other . our folks lived next door for years . " how well did you know your wife before you married her " ?
0	no , i do not , but she 's chummed on me .
0	well , i guess this is a pretty rash adventure . you will not turn back while you can see , and there are safer things than running for a shoal you do not know , in the dark . however , there 's a point one might get a bearing from abeam and i will try to fix our position . it might be useful later .

0	a sixth sense , probably . what did you say your name is ? " i do not know how i can tell , " said the boy indifferently .
0	hallo ! juno , ahoy ! donald was determined not to do anything wrong , and if the captain had committed any evil deed , he fully intended to expose him ; but he meant to keep still until he learned that the evil deed had been done . the money in his pocket , and that for which the juno could be sold , would be capital enough to enable him to carry on the business of boat-building . but he was determined to see captain shivernock that very day in regard to the boat . perhaps the strange man would give him a job to build a centre-board yacht , for he wanted one .
0	seeing what ? " seeing is believing . doc " ? johnny asked , pointing to the cows .

0	o have done , gammer ! if you begin to talk about love , coz , i shall tumble into such a laughing convulsion that i shall not recover from it for this next three days . love ! that stupid word broke the neck of my famous master , pietro . but for this tarantula-dance the great hawk-nose would still be sitting as professor at his lecturing desk , and tickling the young goslings with philosophy and wisdom as they perkt up their yellow beaks to catch the crumbs he dropt into them . marry ! old beldam , this monkey-trick of love , this platonic drunkenness of the soul , was the only thing wanting to us , to me as well as you , and then the miracle of our heroic existence would have been quite perfect . well , goodbye , old dame ; tomorrow night about this time i will come to fetch you , and then we never part more .

0	ah , the solemn-faced intellectuals with their narrow outlook , their atrophied vision , and their long words ! perhaps ! but in fechner 's universe there is room for every grade of spiritual being between man and god . the vaster orders of mind go with the vaster orders of body . he believes passionately in the earth soul , he treats her as our special guardian angel ; we can pray to the earth as men pray to their saints . the earth has a collective consciousness . we rise upon the earth as wavelets rise upon the ocean . we grow out of her soil as leaves grow from a tree . sometimes we find our bigger life and realize that we are parts of her bigger collective consciousness , but as a rule we are aware only of our separateness , as individuals . these moments of cosmic consciousness are rare . they come with love , sometimes with pain , music may bring them too , but above all -- landscape and the beauty of nature ! men are too petty , conceited , egoistic to welcome them , clinging for dear life to their precious individualities .
0	i am glad you find it so ! " it is very interesting , " said the minor poet .
0	curly was not so ripe for picking as you figured , lute . if you ' d asked me , i could a-told you to put in yore spare time letting him alone . but a fellow has to buy his own experience .

0	oh , do not -- please do not ! " oh , miss sadie -- just one word " !
0	do not be alarmed , it 's only the water filling the outer jacket of my _gabion_ . we shall be settled and steady in a moment , and afloat for the night .
0	say i ' m old-fashioned : that 's enough . " very well . i shall say you ' re old-fashioned , and prefer walking up the five flights because you do not like lifts " .
0	yes , i know the door , " there is only one door open , my lord -- a little door by the organ " .
0	esmeralda ! by the living harry ! the startled passenger beside him on the box followed the direction of his eyes . through an opening in the wayside pines he could see , a few hundred yards away , a cuplike hollow in the hillside of the vividest green . in the centre a young girl of fifteen or sixteen was dancing and keeping step to the castanet " click " of a pair of " bones , " such as negro minstrels use , held in her hands above her head . but , more singular still , a few paces before her a large goat , with its neck roughly wreathed with flowers and vines , was taking ungainly bounds and leaps in imitation of its companion . the wild background of the sierras , the pastoral hollow , the incongruousness of the figures , and the vivid color of the girl 's red flannel petticoat showing beneath her calico skirt , that had been pinned around her waist , made a striking picture , which by this time had attracted all eyes . perhaps the dancing of the girl suggested a negro " break-down " rather than any known sylvan measure ; but all this , and even the clatter of the bones , was made gracious by the distance .
0	i do not usually get in anybody 's way . " let me go with you . i never get a moment alone with you . why do you keep out of my way " ?
0	he accused me of being one of the gang , and even threatened to lock me in his cellar . " i figured you ' d got mixed up in it at samuelson 's , somehow . the boys did not know nothin ' about it -- except pierce -- an ' he guessed wrong " .
0	_ce que femme veut , dieu le veut_ , quick moisture gathered in her eyes . " you hurt me , " she said . " you will soon get well and strong again . you must " !
0	stay ! do not stir ! there . answer , now : what did you come in to look at ?
0	which key ? saunderson 's expression showed that he thought dr . cairn to be mad , but nevertheless he plunged his hand into his pocket and pulled out a key-ring . dr . cairn snatched it in a flash .
0	mizzi will have to be woman enough , i ' m afraid . poor ted . their talk at luncheon was all about theodore and his future . fenger said that what theodore needed was a firm and guiding hand . " a sort of combination manager and slave-driver . an ambitious and intelligent wife would do it . that 's what we all need . a woman to work for , and to make us work " .
0	and i hope you made no mistake about _that_ , miss ! _you_ went to her door .
0	have you ? oh ! i heard it was to be to-day ! -- young waldron 's wedding ! yes , they have been long sweethearts .
0	first time i ever heard of your memory needing refreshing ! well , you know how i came back from the wild and woolly west and tried to make a comfortable home for lilian . we were neither of us likely to marry at our time of life , and there were just the two of us left , and we ' d both of us knocked about quite long enough on our own , and so why not settle down together in the old place and be comfortable ? at least that 's how it struck me . of course , as you know , we had not met for so long that we were practically strangers and she knew the ways of civilisation better than me , and i gave her a pretty free hand in setting up the establishment . i do not blame her , mind you , for setting the pace a bit too fast to last . my own blamed fault entirely . however , we are not in a very deep hole , thank the lord . in fact if i had not got to pay sir reginald back the 1,200 it would be all right , so far i can figure out . but i want your exact statement , mr . rattar , and as quick as you can let me have it .
0	i ' m glad to hear it , miss blood . we are companions in hypocrisy . as we are such nonentities we shall not affect each other at all . do not you think so ? what are you laughing at ? i told you what i was laughing at !
0	we ' d better begin with cousin stan first , i ' d like to be his fate , you bet !
0	lu chang is quite quiet and harmless , madame passed into the next room and returned with a small pekinese in her arms .
0	of course you could . but , i had my instructions . i was told to give mr . torrance the message as soon as i could , without troubling anybody . flora schuyler glanced at hetty , and then smiled at the lad . " that is certainly not complimentary , " she said . " do not you think hetty and i could remember anything that you can " ?
0	perhaps you do not want to know why i want to know , " certainly , " he looked up . " but why do you want to know " ?
0	why , i had it in my pocket , and i put it under the cushion for safe keeping . you see , i joined that crowd and they thought i was one of the canal-men . i was with them for ten days at least and finally i found out what i wanted to know .
0	you ' re a good one ! why did not you tell me what you were about ?
0	my best , new hat ! run after him ! meg spread out her skirts . a small , black ball hurled itself through the door , rolled between meg 's feet and jumped to a desk . like a flash the monkey ran lightly over the desk tops , down the aisle , reached the desk where miss mason 's hat lay , and seized it in one paw . she made a frantic grab for it , but missed . with a derisive chuckle and some remark in monkey talk that no one could understand , the monkey gained the open window and scampered down the fire-escape .

0	let it go to the devil , jacques has lost all patience with you .
0	look straight ahead and far away ! in a few moments the boy was at the top of the tree , twined around the trunk , with his legs among the leaves , but his body displayed to view , and the sun beating down on his blond head , which seemed to be of gold . the officer could hardly see him , so small did he seem up there .
0	and what did mr . rowles say about his niece ? " oh , no , sir ; they ' d had enough of her . they said she must go to her home in london . and mrs . rowles knew that you would be going to town to-day , and she promised to send word to you that i would bring this runaway here to meet you ; and mrs . rowles said she knew you would see her safe home , because you are always ready to help everybody " .
0	perfectly , he took good care of us .
0	well , pretty near it -- but i ' m trying to please my best friend now . " but rufus -- would that be the truth " ?
0	no , no ! to do maruja justice , she generally makes a fellow too preposterous to fight . i see you do not understand . you ' re a stranger ; i ' m an old habitue of the house -- let me explain . both of these men are in love with maruja ; or , worse than that , they firmly believe her to be in love with them .
0	ha , ha ! that 's splendid . now , rusty , i want to have you do some more play-acting -- only turn it around . this time i want you to go away weeping , and we will come back laughing !

0	if we can only make it -- oh , we have got to make it now ! the railroad president came sliding down the diminished coal heap at the rear of the tender . he had grasped its rear end , and had climbed over it just as the caboose went hurtling to destruction . the glad delight and relief in the eyes of the young engineer revealed to the official fully his loyal friendship . fogg , catching sight of him , helped him to his feet with a wild hurrah . the fireman 's face shone with new life as he swung to his work at the coal heap .
0	turn him out ! no one wants you here ; do we , padger ? get yourself out of the meeting , you sneak !

0	i was a famished poor little thing , you mean , food has made all the difference , victor , " and so did i you . heaven bless you , child ! i am so happy and thankful to find you here , so healthy and prosperous . you were a sickly , poor little thing when i knew you , " said victor , with much emotion .
0	i do not know much of british life yet , for i have spent nearly all my time in the states and in canada . but i hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here . " i think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting " .
0	if you happen to know which way they went , we might follow and suggest an exchange .
0	true ! this is fortunate , very fortunate ! will you ask her down ?
0	why , friends , we are getting so many notable articles and writers together that we will soon have to raise the subscription price , " then put me down for another serial . i have a collection of short stories that mr . catlin wrote of his adventures in alaska . it does not seem much like an adventure to go to alaska nowadays , but forty years ago it was as if one were leaving this hemisphere for the unknown . some of his tales are intensely interesting , " said mrs . catlin .
0	i wish my dear old dad could have heard you . i remember he once refused to meet a woman doctor in consultation . she had to leave lindum -- no one would employ her . i was a child at the time , but even then it seemed all wrong to me . " i should say " ! agreed the other . " i never was one to be against the men , but oh , my -- " she threw up her bony little hands -- " if there 's one thing i never could abide it 's a man doctor for woman 's work . i s ' pose i got started that way by what my mother told me of the medical students in her day . anyway , it hardly seems christian to me for a woman to go to a man doctor " .
0	that 's just what you ' d like to find out -- is not it ? -- in order to know the line to take in making your explanation . susy was silent : she needed time to reckon up her forces , and study her next move ; and her brain was in such a whirl of fear that she could at last only retort : " what is it that ellie said to you " ?
0	you come here and intermate that any of my family 's thieves , do you ? " dad 's goin ' to lick him " ! squalled one of the girls .
0	and so would i ! " the stone was crumbling , " replied the jester ; " but as for the gold , it will stand the test with me , if you seek it in the heart , and not in the pocket . holy blasius ! would that my grave might lack filling , as long as my little strong-box here ; i ' d willingly allow it " .
0	stop that heifer ! the object of all this friendly solicitude was unconscious of the decided steps taken by mr . grant ; but he ran till he had placed a safe distance between himself and his potent oppressor . he saw plenty of policemen in his flight , but he paid no attention to them , nor even thought what a powerful combination they formed against a weak boy like himself . he was satisfied , however , that he must leave the city ; and when he was out of breath with running , he walked as nearly on a straight course as the streets would permit , till he reached the outskirts of the city .
0	they do not have private views in asia , i suppose , but what a pity that for this year , even in this gorged city , they ' re pretty well over .
0	i thought so , but if you take my advice , you will draw the bit slightly .
0	really , teddy , you ought to be awarded a prize for early rising . i fear i ' m horribly late . it 's ten o ' clock . but mother and i went last night to the aldwych , and afterwards with the baileys to supper at the savoy . so i may be forgiven , may i not -- eh ?
0	aisy all , " she 's there ! she 's yonder ! it 's herself at the door . she 's up . she 's looking out for the coach , " cried the fisherman , clambering up on to the seat .
0	they do not come , shall we then sit here till we grow old ?
0	is not he an anachronism ? i often tell him the reason he has not married is he has never been able to find any one sufficiently early victorian for him . imagine preaching a doctrine of ' thou shalt not write ' to women to-day ! every woman her own authoress is the accepted thing .
0	lieutenant ! lieutenant ! wake up ! i want you to keep watch while i run to headquarters here . there may be news !
0	nellie and her husband are good friends of mine , but sometimes our friends are a little too officious . anyway , it does not count . if you had had that right , you would have told me to go . " in one sense i did . i suggested that there was no reason why you should listen to me " .
0	there 's gratitude for you ! if i had your share of the wharton coin i ' d let ' em hang me -- for a while . lorelei lifted a tragic , tear-stained face . " i ought to be hanged , " she said .
0	not a bit more than you deserve , i am sure , now , miss , if you are ready , i am .
0	spoken like my daughter ! but i thought new dolls in this house were always surprises . and here 's mrs . minister making doll petticoats out in the open !
0	good lord ! what is it ? jethro hallett jumped aside .
0	what have you in your hand , katy ? has he written one to save me the trouble ? " he said , as you are his friend , you would not object to giving him one " .
0	ahoy , billy topsail ! archie bounded up the gangplank , crossed the deck in three leaps and stuck his head into the forecastle .
0	think ! think ! i know ! guilty ? the man 's black with guilt .
0	my nerves are better than yours , it was only to speak to you about that particular night that i braved the danger of hunting you up . i need you as a witness , and that is why you see me here .
0	you please me , my son . the white fathers called this the time of chaos , though time of change would be more accurate , particularly where the lives of those on your team are concerned . joan is the herald of the promised one , and will act as that one 's surrogate for a time , though she will not be asked to bear that burden permanently , and would be far happier if she is not forced to acknowledge her temporary protectorship . odeon hesitated in turn , then nodded , slowly . " from anyone else , i ' d say no -- but from you , i can manage " .
0	does not it strike you that you ' re urging conflicting reasons ? first you declare that fuller was drunk , and then that he was able to detect clever players at cheating . your argument contradicts itself and is plainly absurd . " that 's a risk you should have taken . for another thing , fuller states that a trump was played by a man who ought not to have had it " .
0	a gray touring-car , it stopped here . we saw it from that hill . then the damn tire burst , and we lost our way . where did he go ?
0	how clever you ' re getting ! but it is not a cheque i want this time . it 's only a motor car .
0	well , yes , and she may succeed too . the greater the sin the deeper the repentance . the unfortunate woman --
0	hurrah ! hurrah ! now she will have to eat some of our lovely things .
0	hyeh he is , men , come in hyeh an ' git him .
0	great ? in what way ?
0	ah-h ! " sir redmond is in helena , on business . he 's been making arrangements to lease a lot of land " .
0	no , it does not ! i shall not bother with it any more . i ' m tired of fooling with it when it acts like that . i will throw it out and play with my corncob doll this morning .
0	get their clothes , jack ! they were carrying them in a bundle . they can not go very far that way .
0	do not get fresh , we ' re after business .
0	foolish , betty ! " i did not mean to , " said the child . she was searching for her handkerchief and the little cherries bobbed forward . " i did not know they would spill " ! she had found the handkerchief now and was wiping them away , and she smiled at miss stone -- a brave smile -- that was going to be happy --
0	i ' m afraid we would not stand much chance with her , " maybe she wants to give us a race , " suggested noddy .
0	come on ! we have got to get to the mill and have them turn the water through the race . then we have got to get a boat out there -- quick !
0	you know what i mean , " circumvented you mean , " westy said .
0	leave that to me , i fancy i will find a way to get plenty of sport out of this business . you know those two old horse-pistols that are hung up for relics in the armory ?
0	we . " nay , sahib . it is thus . at sea , on the black water , we have room to be blown up and down without care . here we have no room at all . look you , we have put the river into a dock , and run her between stone sills " .
0	wilson ! a sharp sound : the man was cocking his revolver . shears rushed into the shrubbery . the other had no time to turn : the englishman was upon him . there was a violent and desperate struggle , amid which shears was aware that the man was making every effort to draw his knife . but shears , stimulated by the thought of his coming victory and by the fierce longing to lay hold at once of this accomplice of ars ne lupin 's , felt an irresistible strength welling up within himself . he threw his adversary , bore upon him with all his weight and , holding him down with his five fingers clutching at his throat like so many claws , he felt for his electric lantern with the hand that was free , pressed the button and threw the light upon his prisoner 's face :
0	okay , then , no kickin ' or gougin ' . a man 's down , he has a chance to get up . that 's all the rules . right ?
0	what ! i will tell you . for the same reason that they do not make you o . c . in this battalion , you damned fat lobster ! there now , you have started me swearin ' again , and i was quittin ' it .
0	i should call him blood and bones , " bones , your excellency , " said hamilton miserably .
0	it was something about yourself that it was natural one should not forget -- that is if one remembered you at all . that 's why i ask you , if the thing you then spoke of has ever come to pass ?
0	a signal gun , " bang " !
0	get it on paper , kid ! " do not think i missed seeing a thing like that . i have already posed her in a dozen ways in my mind , " answered shirley .
0	my wife -- my wife is dying . she may die any day , in at the kitchen door came windy , far gone in drink . he stood by the door holding to the knob with his hand and trying to get control of himself .
0	the artifacts are very carefully replaced . the technicians -- again , as far as we know -- have accepted the evidence of their eyes . " what about the technicians who are actually working there " ? asked turnbull .
0	i do not believe the telegraph there is working , but suit yourself . i must go back to new york to arrange for the goods we will have to take with us . in a week , tom , we will start .
0	we will take her down , do not worry yourself ! we must just wait for a good opportunity , and then --
0	ay , ay ! on the port tack .
0	what will we do , anyway ? everything wants to fly all over the place !
0	huzzay for colonel clark ! i will foller him into canady , and stand up to my lick log .
0	i want you fellows to take your gear and go back north ! i will fix you yet for this !
0	oh , don , do be serious !
0	and why not , pray ? rubbish ! what does it matter in the end ? comes to the same thing when you do know them .
0	using your head ? " that i ai not goin ' to be too proud to borrow it off ' m , if he is a chink . he 's a white one , an ' maybe i will need it . because , you see -- well , you can not guess what i have been up to since i seen you this mornin ' . i have been so busy i ai not had a bite to eat " .
0	it 's a lie ! he 's a thief .
0	it failed before . " no " ! and the speaker glanced at him scornfully . " well , thurston must finish by next summer , or his conditional grants are subject to revision , while it 's quite plain he can only work in the ca on in winter . something in the accident line has got to happen " .
0	go ahead , scott , you need not worry . you have a friend !
0	hold it ! let 's not get violent .
0	oh ! we will treat sister janet better than that , my dear , " it will buy a handsome wedding present for sister janet " ! she exclaimed , smoothing out the bills as she counted them one by one .
0	it shore do ! " pretty slick work -- i will give del pinzo credit for that , " said slim , as if it were already established that the wily greaser halfbreed had made the descent on happy valley . " how he and his bunch could haze cattle this far into a rocky pass , an ' then make ' em disappear , gets me " !
0	ha ! ha ! ha ! boiled , indeed ! a pretty boil we could have in a tin cup , holding less than a pint . i wish we _could_ have a boiled joint and a bowl of soup . i ' d give something for it . i ' m precious tired of this everlasting dry roast .
0	we left word at the door , for i wanted to behold you before the blood and dust of the arena settled over all .
0	that i will not ! " uncle , you ' re not making time , " said drake after a few miles . " i will thank you for the reins . open your bandanna and get your concertina . jerk the bellows for us " .
0	come on , twaddles , we ' re going back .
0	silence ! you will do nothing of the kind . -- look here , lennox .
0	who art thou ? now upon a day , eric having made an end of sowing his corn , bethought himself of his vow to go up alone against skallagrim the baresark in his den on mosfell over by hecla . now , this was a heavy task : for skallagrim was held so mighty among men that none went up against him any more ; and at times eric thought of gudruda , and sighed , for it was likely that she would be a widow before she was made a wife . still , his oath must be fulfilled , and , moreover , of late skallagrim having heard that a youngling named eric brighteyes had vowed to slay him single-handed , had made of a mock of him in this fashion . for skallagrim rode down to coldback on ran river and at night-time took a lamb from the fold . holding the lamb beneath his arm , he drew near to the house and smote thrice on the door with his battle-axe , and they were thundering knocks . then he leapt on to his horse and rode off a space and waited . presently eric came out , but half clad , a shield in one hand and whitefire in the other , and , looking , by the bright moonlight he saw a huge black-bearded man seated on a horse , having a great axe in one hand and the lamb beneath his arm .
0	i think there is , though i can not be sure . the legislature must do something for us sooner or later , while the fact that the cattle-men and the sheriff have left us alone of late shows that they do not feel too secure . still , there may be trouble . a good many hard cases have been coming in . " you must have put a good many dollars into your ploughing , larry , and the few i had have gone in the same way , " he said . " you see , it 's a long while until harvest comes round , and a good many unexpected things seem to happen in this country . to be quite straight , is there much probability of our getting any of those dollars back " ?
0	i say , you young cub down there , come up and swab this deck .
0	can you see , phillimore ? it was towards the dawn that , stopping in my walk , i listened , and heard amid the whistling of the wind and the wash of the water a little mutter of sound somewhere in the disintegrating darkness below . i called to legrand under my breath , and i heard his " hist " . he was at attention , his ears straining in the wind to get news of what was passing . then there was a shot , and the noise of a _m l e_ at the ladder . oaths and shouts and the reports of revolvers echoed from the wooden walls .
0	i am not sure myself . " art thou sad about captain wardour " ? and the little maid looked up with lustrous and sympathetic eyes , wondering at the long silence . " and do you think he could find my mother and my father ? it must be a beautiful world , that heaven , if it is so much finer and better than this , and flowers bloom all the time and the trees never get stripped by the cruel autumn winds and the birds go on singing . i shall love to listen to them . but , aunt , what will people do who are like rachel and think listening idle and sinful , and that flowers are fripperies that spoil the hay and prevent the grass from growing in that space " ?
0	destroyed him ? be none so sure of that . he has grown rich , i hear . he has translated , so it is said , his spanish spoils into french gold , which is being treasured up for him in france . his future father-in-law , m . d ' ogeron , has seen to that .
0	damnation ! did you ever hear the word prosperity , you ninny ? did you ever hear the word ambition ? did you ever hear the word progress ?
0	and why the devil was not it sabres ! one to three -- and six more below ! sepp , you disgust me . carry him out !
0	all that you say may be true , but that does not alter the fact that you delivered it up the moment you discovered the rightful owner . and miss phyllis 's clever little ruse of burying the false box probably saved geoffrey a bad time . for if those fellows had not found _something_ there that night , they would certainly have made it hot for him . as it was , it gained us so much time that detective barnes had a chance to get my man out of their clutches before they had done him any damage , though they were furious at being duped . they ' re all safely in jail now , and there is nothing more to fear from them . of course , the principal who hired them is safe , over in china , but he did not gain _his_ point , -- and that 's the main thing ! as for the letters , i concluded that , after all , my ideas as to how to keep them safely were out of date , and they have long since been forwarded to washington , in care of barnes , and are now in the hands of my country 's representative there . i shall not concern myself any further about their security .
0	shut up , kid ! i know just how you feel about it ; feel that way myself . but there ai not a-going to be no fighting while i have got these cows on my han 's . that gang will be here when we come back , all right .
0	that 's what i wanted to know ! " listen to me " ! she said beseechingly , and stamped one little foot upon the floor -- " listen to me ! you are a clever man , but you know nothing of a woman 's heart -- nothing -- _nothing_ -- if seeing me , hearing me , knowing , as you do know , what i risk , you can doubt that i speak the truth . and i tell you that it is death to go behind those curtains -- that _he_ " .
0	man the braces , fore and main ! round-in upon the starboard main and topsail braces , for your lives , men ; shift over the trysail-sheet like lightning ! hurrah , lads ! over with it before the gale strikes us again ! well there with the starboard main-braces ; haul taut and make fast to port ; swing your head-yards ; and get the starboard staysail sheet aft . here comes the wind again ; but , thank god , _we are saved_ !
0	well , charles , do you think i was made to order for you ? her husband , who had picked up some of penloe 's ideas , said : " why , clara , she was made to order for him " .
0	hooray ! " i do not object if mr . phipps accompanies them " .
0	tell it , if you ' re sure it will not hurt us , " i tell you what " ! exclaimed jennie stone .
0	we sha not fight this time , i promise . freddy laughed . " back again to the tabooed subject " ?
0	nais is quite welcome to my leavings , i will look down upon your country cooings when presently i go back to the place behind the stars from which i came . you are a very rustic person , deucalion . they tell me too that three or four of these smelling old men up here have named you king . did you swell much with dignity ? or did you remember that there was a pretty empress left that would still be empress so long as there was an atlantis to govern ? come , sir , find your tongue . by my face ! you must have hungered for me very madly these years we have been parted , if new-grown ruggedness of feature is an evidence .
0	it would take a three-inch field piece , sir , to make an impression on this wall of dirt , " that will do , sergeant , " nodded lieutenant prescott at last .
0	you . -- boy -- confound you , can not you hear ? oh , he 's got a devil of a temper , has that clerk . some day , tom , when you love me very much , go up to the hotel and break his face for me .
0	but the sentiment -- come now -- the sentiment ? do you perceive any hint of emptiness -- despair ? " well , in the first place , my luncheon did not disagree with me . it never does " .
0	i am afraid i will have a hard time living up to captain fronte 's standard , " aye , an ' twill tashte good , too , av ye fly at ut befure ut gits cold . ye have had shleep enough fer two min -- captain fronte ' d git along fer wakes at a toime on foorty winks in th ' saddle " .
0	randy ! randy ! come out here ! light the lantern and waken the boys .
0	why , pa ! whereupon mrs . middlerib asked him if he had eaten anything that disagreed with him , and miss middlerib said :
0	si ! i understand . an anger against himself flushed his cheek . " i do not know which road i will take , madre , -- after i leave here , -- this country . but i shall always remember . . . and tell nell . . . that . . " . he hesitated .
0	dead , francisco dead ! why then are we still live ?
0	fools ! do you think that the old fox has wasted the time we have given him ? you may be sure that the richest prizes have been carried above .
0	major derevaux ! an officer on horseback dashed up to general french and the two held a short conversation . as the rider turned and was about to make off again the lads recognized him .

0	you ' re too green t ' eat , young feller . your improvements ! the law will sing another tune . " i ' m kickin ' about payin ' you twice f ' r my own things , my own fences , my own kitchen , my own garden " .
0	chatellerault , abandon these defensive subterfuges ; confess that you are but uttering excuses , and acknowledge that you have conducted this affair with a clumsiness unpardonable in one equipped with your advantages of courtly rearing .
0	i ' m not worrying much -- " one , if you please , mr . craik . is the danger for you also " ?
0	well , now , that may be . dr . turnbull . if so , then they ' re engaged in something that 's above my level . " i was under the impression , " turnbull said easily , " that scholar duckworth was engaged in some sort of work with scholar rawlings " .
0	you mean less expensive . there 's one of the great big differences between you and the make-believe ladies one bumps into in this part of town . _you_ do not like to be troublesome or expensive . but we will go to the knickerbocker . i feel ' way down today , and i intended to treat myself . you do not look any too gay-hearted yourself . " oh , no -- a quieter place , " urged susan .
0	blank your blank ugly mug ! do you mean to say , --
0	i do not want to go to bed , ai not he santa claus ? he said he was santa claus . where are my presents ? where 's my air-gun ? i want my presents . oh -- oh -- oh !
0	we ' re not swell , " maybe i will make some awful blunders , " miles confided to him on the way to the house . " remember i have never been with swell folks before " .

0	well , you know , moise and his ' cousins ' are all ' same like dog , ' as he would say , your feet get used to it in time . these men have never known anything better , so they have got adjusted to the way they have to make their living . i doubt if they would wear hard-soled shoes if they had them , because they would say the soles would slip on the rocks . they ' re in the water about as much as they are out of it when they are tracking a boat up-stream . that 's the way this country was conquered for the white men -- by the paddle , pole , and tracking line .
0	the bear was sham ! the tiger was sham ! both of them were stuffed with straw , and landed before you saw them with jup brass and his companions !
0	is this another of your d -- d tricks ? if it is , whoever was listening may hear the rest . you and pennington lawton between you , drove my wife to suicide , but you will not drive _me_ there ! i ' m ruined , and broken , and hopeless , but i will live on , live till i ' m even , do you hear ? live till i ' m square with the game !
0	ho ! ho ! you are become plural are you , rascals ? how many are there of you , thieves ? what , i warrant , you thought to rob and murder a poor harmless cottager and his wife , and did not dream of a garrison ? you looked for no weapon of opposition but spit , poker , and basting ladle , wielded by unskilful hands : but , rascals , here is short sword and long cudgel in hands well tried in war , wherewith you shall be drilled into cullenders and beaten into mummy .
0	yes , i believe i was , " i thought i heard you singing as i entered , " he said .
0	how long will she last ? " she loosened three plates on her port quarter and she 's filling fast " .
0	it would be very nice , if it were only another color . what will happen to it ? " well , how about it ? have not you seen enough of it " ?
0	nothing of the sort , nan . i have had a few lessons , that is all . but mrs . newton broke in before the governess could reply for herself . " graduated ! well , i should think so ! why , she has carried off honors ! she has taken a diploma -- with a ribbon ' round it " !
0	the car 's got a sense of beauty , it chooses carefully when it wants to break down .
0	i am a jew , and what of that ? a co-religionist of jesus , of saint paul , of the other saints who are venerated on the altars . the butifarras boast of their ancestors , but they date scarcely further back than yesterday . i am more noble , more ancient ! my forefathers were the patriarchs of the bible !
0	i am going to gaze in a window where there are pippins on view . verelst put out a hand . " dunwoodie is sure to look in . where are you off to " ?
0	miss elinor marshall , i am , as i have before remarked , your humble and adoring slave . your will is law . when shall we start ? she nodded , an emphatic , half-fierce little nod , and frowned .
0	besides , it 's not really so bad . i have a house in shadow hill to which i can retreat when i sell this one ; and with a tiny income from the sale of this house , and with what i can earn , i ought to be able to support myself very nicely . " of course it scared me for a few minutes . i could not help that . but after i got over the first unpleasant -- feeling , i concluded to go about my business in life until it came time for me to adjust myself to the scheme of things " .
0	he seemed very intelligent , poor fellow , in some ways . did not you notice what a cultivated tone he had ? it 's shocking to think of his having to go about and interview people , and meet all kinds of rebuffs . " well , i must send it to him . and i will -- i will write him a note , " hilary groaned .
0	congratulations , garland was waiting in front of a cafe and greeted him with a mocking grin .
0	ah , you might well be that , " then your ideal girl " .
0	what ! do you call that thanking him ? i heard that all right , but devil take me if i guessed it was meant for swann . you may be quite sure he never noticed it .
0	course it will not ! you can not make it go without you got a real horn . i ' m goin ' to get me a real horn some day before long , and then you will see me goin ' up and down here playin ' it like sixty ! i will --
0	soft as to you , perhaps , i consider him a very civil , respectable man , afy .

0	so you could not leave me , after all ! well , come back to bed now , and i will tell you all about it .

0	if it 's true , it 's splendid . he deserves it too . oh , i ' m glad -- i ' m so glad . the crowd responded in a hoarse shout for o ' ryan and his fortune . even the women shouted -- all except molly mackinder . she was wondering if o ' ryan risen would be the same to her as o ' ryan rising . she got into her carriage with a sigh , though she said to the few friends with her :
0	of course it was the ride . and i admit that she was very gay , " which excited her excessively , i should say , if it really _was_ the ride " .
0	amen ! on forty-eight days we will begin .

0	but the land is there , i tell you , but morning broke clear , with a blazing tropic sun . the southeast trade had swung around to the eastward , and was driving the pyrenees through the water at an eight-knot clip . captain davenport worked up his dead reckoning , allowing generously for drift , and announced moerenhout island to be not more than ten miles off . the pyrenees sailed the ten miles ; she sailed ten miles more ; and the lookouts at the three mastheads saw naught but the naked , sun-washed sea .
0	we will give them the slip soon enough , just as we did to their masters , wait .

0	truesdale ! calm down !
0	then , when we meet , the question will be who shall turn round and go back , and who keep on , " that would be nice , " said zoe , " but do not you suppose they may be improving the sleighing opportunity as well as ourselves ? may be driving over here to call on us " ?

0	there , it 's right side up , that is , if you can tell me what direction is ' up ' out here in space . and , as for the names , do not let them disturb you ; they do not mean anything . some old-timer with a little three-inch telescope probably named them . the darker areas looked like seas to them . astronomers have known better for a long time ; and you and i -- we ' re darned sure of it now .

0	now -- now -- do not call him names , labanya . i forgive him with all my heart , and bless him too . put the cloud of misfortune had its silver lining . that he was not a mere cypher was clear from the fact that the anglo-indian community on the one side and the congress on the other were each waiting patiently , eager to hook him , and land him on their own side . so nabendu , beaming with pleasure took the paper to his sister-in-law , and showed her the letter . looking as though she knew nothing about it , labanya exclaimed in surprise : " oh , what a pity ! everything has come out ! who bore you such ill-will ? oh , how cruel of him , how wicked of him " !

0	at this rate , it will not take us long to get to paris .
0	sometimes anger serves a good purpose , but it was pitiful to look at poor old dr . thornton yesterday afternoon . at first i thought he was going to faint . he seemed suddenly to grow ten years older . it cut him to the quick . he loves every one of his boys , and to have one of them go bad is just as painful to him as to see his own son sent to the penitentiary .

0	as a matter of fact , that 's a thing i have been thinking over rather often the last few months , it 's rather a pity you do not seem to like cooking , sally .
0	which leaves nothing , " i always do , " was the comment . " but i will tell you what i demand in any one associated with me -- absolute trustworthiness first of all , then loyalty and ability " .
0	he 's left a lot of good friends behind him anyhow . but it 's strange he could drop off the earth without a soul knowing about it . " you have said it , " chunn agreed .
0	that 's just the reason , you are too interested . you are too beautiful to wear it . i am a man ; i revel in trouble ; you are a girl . it would not be honourable to allow you to take it . i shall keep it .
0	there you have me , inconsistent , was not it ? but we ' re only human : one needs rest and food .

0	you seem to have an accommodating disposition , why did not you stop the cook , who went out a little while ago ? perhaps he would have been glad of your company .
0	it is not life , when some other fellow is dancing with your girl .
0	you will have your liberty soon , i think it will be safe to let you go down to the dining-room this evening , and i will give you your honourable discharge in the morning . but , if i were in your place , i would make no attempt to catch up with the classes this term . i would lock the unfinished presents away in a drawer , and not give any this christmas . you ought to spend the holidays as quietly as possible , doing nothing but rest .
0	yes , yes , we will do so , we will let the french come to innspruck , but only as our prisoners .
0	it is a most romantic explanation , but her third husband , lord henry ! you do not mean to say ferrol is the fourth .
0	joe calvin -- you devil , let her go -- let her go .
0	it 's only worth talking about , mio caro , from your having begun it . my question is only reasonable -- so that your idea may stand or fall by your answer to it . if i should pin one of these things on for you would it be , to your mind , that i might go home and show it to maggie as your present ?
0	i beg your pardon , but you must lay yours down first .

0	tut ! if you insist on telling my fortune , tell me a pleasant one , and i will pay you double , " cleaner than yours will be when it is stained with blood , young maiden " !
0	and many more are not ! and after a time the answer came back , " neegah and the six young men are not " .
0	oh , yes , she is . she 's going to do quite a lot of objecting . you better stay right where you are , scotty . you ' re a heap safer . " oh , well , now " ! the sheriff rather prided himself on his ability to " handle folks peaceable , " as he expressed it . he injected a little more of the oil of persuasiveness into his voice . it was his standard recipe for avoiding trouble with a woman . " you do not think for a minute i ' d take advantage of his absence , mrs . lorrigan ? nothing like that at all . we just want to see if a certain cowhide is here . if it is not , then we will not need to bother tom at all , maybe . get down , mr . douglas , and we will just have a look around . mrs . lorrigan ai not going to make no objections to that " .
0	do you know why , do you know why , anyway , why you did all this , and why you are resolved on such a punishment now !
0	then we ' re being torn to pieces by the impossible ! before we even know they are anywhere around , they are blasting us with everything they have got ! not even the strategic genius of general macmaine can help us if we have no time to plot strategy !

0	how old are you , brent ? " it 's my happiest birthday , too " !
0	what 's wrong with it ? junie helped me choose it , and she generally knows , susy stood up abruptly , and straightened the expensive hat which hung irresponsibly over grace 's left ear .
0	do not blame him for what ? " i do not blame him , " said the fat boy .
0	well , she got it . mr . longdon -- but not too grossly -- wondered . " how did he get it " ?
0	the whole thing is very funny , why , you were eager to hammer thornton , and the fellow was afraid you would , for all the bluff he put up .
0	we ' re going back . we will face it together and we will conquer it together . you will not be alone now . darling , do not you see -- it 's because you are not a clod , because you ' re sensitive and imaginative that you experience fear . it 's not anything to be ashamed of . you were simply the first man on earth to develop a new and completely different kind of fear -- time fear . " you see , darling , a compulsive fear is not easy to conquer . no man or woman can conquer it alone . historians tell us that when the first passenger rocket started out for mars , space fear took men by surprise in the same way your fear gripped you . the loneliness , the utter desolation of space , was too much for a human mind to endure " .

0	bulson ! ravell bulson . i own that milk .
0	do you good to try . you will not succeed . no one ever does . i gather the main trouble is that dick has gone to town when you did not want him to . husbands are like that sometimes , you know . are you afraid he will not come back -- or that he will ? " i shall begin to hate you directly , " remarked juliet with her wan smile .
0	now i will confess ! i have a doll trunk under my bed where it can not be seen , and sometimes when i am all alone , i still play with them .

0	i did not hear anything ; i will not say or do anything , the big kuzaks , usually easy and steady and not too comical , both had a certain kind of expression , now -- like amused and secretive gorillas . frank was not sure whether he got the meaning of this or not , but right then he felt sort of sympathetic to tiflin , too .
0	you were talking with him -- you were too absorbed : that 's what margot remembers . oh francie , francie ! " well , i did not see her , " the girl said .

0	you have pluck , but do not know the strain that the wives of the struggling farmers have to bear . my object is to see that you do not know . but there 's another thing , harder to explain ; you felt that i neglected you , and i fear i did !

0	it was not exactly cumbered with them . " yes . if authors were not almost necessarily recluses , and ignorant of the ignorance about them , i do not see how they could endure it . of course they are fated to be overwhelmed by oblivion at last , poor fellows ; but to see it weltering all round them while they are in the very act of achieving immortality must be tremendously discouraging . i do not suppose that we who have the habit of reading , and at least a nodding acquaintance with literature , can imagine the bestial darkness of the great mass of people -- even people whose houses are rich and whose linen is purple and fine . but occasionally we get glimpses of it . i suppose you found the latest publications lying all about in lapham cottage when you were down there " ?

0	she 's a tough one , and mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time on the spine of the luckless mare . she sank back on her haunches , but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force , tugged first on one side and then on the other , trying to move the cart . but the six whips were attacking her in all directions , and the shaft was raised again and fell upon her a third time , then a fourth , with heavy measured blows . mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow .
0	that makes me think of another story i read the other day about great-uncle andrew king and aunt georgina , it happened eighty years ago . it was a very stormy winter and the roads were bad . uncle andrew lived in carlisle , and aunt georgina -- she was miss georgina matheson then -- lived away up west , so he could not get to see her very often . they agreed to be married that winter , but georgina could not set the day exactly because her brother , who lived in ontario , was coming home for a visit , and she wanted to be married while he was home . so it was arranged that she was to write uncle andrew and tell him what day to come . she did , and she told him to come on a tuesday . but her writing was not very good and poor uncle andrew thought she wrote thursday . so on thursday he drove all the way to georgina 's home to be married . it was forty miles and a bitter cold day . but it was not any colder than the reception he got from georgina . she was out in the porch , with her head tied up in a towel , picking geese . she had been all ready tuesday , and her friends and the minister were there , and the wedding supper prepared . but there was no bridegroom and georgina was furious . nothing uncle andrew could say would appease her . she would not listen to a word of explanation , but told him to go , and never show his nose there again . so poor uncle andrew had to go ruefully home , hoping that she would relent later on , because he was really very much in love with her .

0	by the blood of issus , i believe they will hold ! above the roof of the palace that housed the jed of gathol and his entourage , the cruiser vanator tore at her stout moorings . the groaning tackle bespoke the mad fury of the gale , while the worried faces of those members of the crew whose duties demanded their presence on the straining craft gave corroborative evidence of the gravity of the situation . only stout lashings prevented these men from being swept from the deck , while those upon the roof below were constantly compelled to cling to rails and stanchions to save themselves from being carried away by each new burst of meteoric fury . upon the prow of the vanator was painted the device of gathol , but no pennants were displayed in the upper works since the storm had carried away several in rapid succession , just as it seemed to the watching men that it must carry away the ship itself . they could not believe that any tackle could withstand for long this titanic force . to each of the twelve lashings clung a brawny warrior with drawn short-sword . had but a single mooring given to the power of the tempest eleven short-swords would have cut the others ; since , partially moored , the ship was doomed , while free in the tempest it stood at least some slight chance for life .

" i surely would " ! he said cordially , offering his hand in adieu -- " i want to ask you a lot of questions and we can talk over all those jolly old times , " -- as though years of comradeship lay behind them instead of an hour or two . then his glance fell on the slim hand he was shaking , and he saw the strap-watch which he had given her still clasped around her wrist .

0	who is it ? the three miscreants who had tried to torture me had endeavoured to escape by letting themselves down by a rope from the top of the tower . two had succeeded and one had been killed . the reason of this was obvious , the rope had been fixed round one of the battlements and it had not been sufficiently strong to maintain the weight of the three men . the two lowest had probably got off with a shaking , the man who had got on the rope last had lost his life . all this was perfectly evident .

0	it 's a very dangerous feeling , you know that an average of sixteen suicides a year take place here at the falls . people cannot resist the fascination of the rushing water . many times no real reason can be given for these acts of self-destruction . you know there are moments when every human brain falters and seems touched by the fleeting finger of insanity . people who stand on great heights often feel an almost irresistible longing to fling themselves down . here they are attacked by a mad longing to cast themselves into the clutch of the rapids .

0	you seem to know a dale , sir , do you know what it is to be saved ?
0	tom 's caught the bear ! can you hold him , tom ?
0	for heaven 's sake , mollie , get out of the way ! start the car ! for a moment the outdoor girls sat fascinated , paralyzed , without the power to move a muscle . then suddenly grace seemed galvanized to action , she leaned toward mollie , grasping the steering wheel of the motionless car frantically .
0	mix another one , jo . tee turned and saw a barrel-chested red-haired giant holding up a drink in the immemorial bar toast . he raised his own glass gingerly , but his trembling hand caused the layers to mix and he stared ruefully at the resultant clayey-looking mess .
0	i will run a foot race with you when we get ashore , " i was afraid walt would go over the falls , pony and all , " he explained , wheeling alongside ned rector and picking him up from the rock .
0	we must know , " gentlemen , " replied barbicane , " i know no more than you do " .
0	i suppose it is natural to a woman to have more curiosity than a man . i never had much of that stuff . anania 's got enough for both . " but it do not seem natural like " !

0	like the sausages , i have fished out of my cabbages , after all i cannot invite you to be my guest , for it would be a compliment to this dish if i were now to call it cabbage with sausages . i have worked it like a mine , and now that the vein of sausages is nearly exhausted , little remains but the native soil in which two or three miserable fragments remain as memorials of past wealth . but my mother shall cook you a mess of it before long , and she prepares it with incomparable skill .

0	you will have to learn german , then , i ' m afraid . it is still in circulation in germany , i believe , on its merits as a serious book . i have not a copy of the edition in english . that was all exhausted by collectors who bought it for its supposed obscenity , like burton 's ' arabian nights end_sentence_quote come this way , and i will show you my laboratory .

0	lord sinan , this is murder . am i , who have done you so much service , to be butchered for your pleasure by the lovers of that woman , whom you would honour with the name of wife ?
0	why , ferrers is called one of the worst grinds in the service , overton , i know it to be a fact that algy ferrers , for the last year , has been returning all the remittances that his father sent him . algy simply wrote back that , by the time he had his day 's work done , he was too tired to go out and spend money .

0	vlasov is coming ! they walked along the street quickly and silently . the mother panted with the exertion of the rapid gait and her excitement . she felt that something big was happening . at the factory gates a throng of women were discussing the affair in shrill voices . when the three pushed into the yard , they found themselves in the thick of a crowd buzzing and humming in excitement . the mother saw that all heads were turned in the same direction , toward the blacksmith 's wall , where sizov , makhotin , vyalov , and five or six influential , solid workingmen were standing on a high pile of old iron heaped on the red brick paving of the court , and waving their hands .
0	ha , bad as that ? " let you know when i find my quarry " .

0	yes , i know , and i guess genevieve has been something of a trial -- in a way ; though they love her dearly -- both of them . she 's a very lovable girl . but she _is_ heedless and thoughtless ; and , of course , she was not at all used to our ways here in the east . her mother died when she was eight years old ; since then she has been brought up by her father on the ranch . she blew into sunbridge last august like a veritable breeze from her own prairies -- and the kennedy home is not used to breezes -- especially miss jane . i imagine genevieve did stir things up a little there all winter -- though she has improved a great deal since she came .

0	has not a phase of the duality of our nature ever struck you ? we have a primary or everyday nature -- a thing of habit , tradition , circumstance ; and we also have a secondary nature which clamours for various sensations and is quite contented with vicarious gratification . there are delicately fibred novelists who satisfy a sort of secondary berserkism by writing books whose pages reek with bloodshed . the most placid , benevolent , gold-spectacled paterfamilias i know , a man who thinks it cruel to eat live oysters , has a curious passion for crime and gratifies it by turning his study into a _musee maccabre_ of murderers ' relics . from the thumb-joint of a notorious criminal he can savour exquisitely morbid emotions , while the blood-stains on an assassin 's knife fill him with the delicious lust of slaughter . in the same way predestined spinsters obtain vicarious enjoyment of the tender passion by reading highly coloured love-stories . " what a second-hand old brigand you are , " cried pasquale , who during my speech had been examining the carpet by the side of his chair .
0	oh , it 's always the same ! year before last i got so i could do it quite respectably , and then last year i had to learn all over again . i really thought i ' d pick it up where i left off this year , but you see how it is ! the very sight of the ice when i ' m on skates makes me quake .

0	heaven deliver us both ! imagine the situation ! go and advise her yourself . " talk to her ; give her some good advice " .

0	i have come for a thing a deal more precious , sir governor , -- a thing worth more to me than all the treasure of the indies with manoa and el dorado thrown in , -- to wit , the thing upon which i have set my mind . that which i determine to do , i do , sir , and the thing i determine to have , why , sooner or later , by hook or by crook , fair means or foul , i have it ! i am not one to be crossed or defied with impunity . the governor took the packet with reverence . " his majesty 's will is our law , " he said . " anything that lies in our power , sir ; though if you come for gold " --

0	pray stop ! you actually make me blush .
0	to marry for love -- oh , i do not mean there is no marrying for love . i mean there is nothing so deceptive as love 's counterfeit , and other considerations masquerade under it unguessed , perhaps . many men and women are , doubtless , honest in thinking when they marry that they love each other , but if they live long enough a large proportion find out their mistake .
0	i never done it ! i swear to god --
0	no matter , we do not want to catch anything in them -- they ' re only there to keep us from being surprised .
0	you ' re a tough kid , i like you , and i ' d take you if i could . but this is not an enterprise for a boy , and it will not get you anything to keep up this racket .
0	look ! he pushed her away , and his blue eyes were impassioned .
0	let us in , mother connelly : we want some bread and butter ! the pounding increased . rose ran down stairs wild with affright , followed by her sister . the boys fortunately were asleep in the back chambers .
0	well , i hardly think you need do that . " well , " drawled the stranger , " in the sense of lacking it , perhaps , but i fear there is no place now for a minstrel , except nigger minstrel . i must apologize for not blacking my face " .
0	i am afraid i do not remember that so well as i do the fox story , but maybe i will think of some more about her . come , it is time to go in . they may be eating those chicken or turkey sandwiches this very minute . " then tell me again about the lady and the willow tree , " begged edna ; " that was so funny " .
0	great country , jombateeste !

0	well , we will try and avoid the latter , if possible , still , for your satisfaction , i may say there is just the chance of a scrimmage . and now i really must go , because i have any amount of work to do for gates . till half-past seven , _au revoir_ .

0	that will never do ! suppose you climb down and let danny grin take your place at the reins until the next halt . i suspect that danny boy already has a few pebbles in his shoes , and that he will be glad enough to look over the world from the driver 's seat .

0	what mistake ? while you beat about the bush i shall never understand you .
0	yes , and shoes , and various other things . " and your shirts " ?
0	we must keep as far apart from each other as we can , the wretched place has no solid foundation , it 's only a collection of sticks and leaves . cling to the trees , and try to get back to the boat before you go in any deeper . do not put your weight on it ! it 's like walking on thin ice .
0	oh , i do not know . i feel very secure about you .
0	that is nice , a child appeared in the doorway , hesitated and came out to her . excusing this approach was the desire for help with a certain sum , but the true reason later became manifest when the little one , with dancing eyes , whispered something to the teacher 's inclined ear .

0	hurrah ! prussia is safe now , for baron von stein is back again , and he will know how to expel napoleon and his french from the country . where minister von stein is he tolerates no french , and that is the reason why bonaparte hates him , and has always been afraid of him . my boy , this is glorious news ! stein is back again ; now we shall be all right ! have you any other news ?
0	how dare you talk to me in that way ? " poor dear lucinda ! i do not wonder that she should be driven beyond herself by so horrible a story . the feeling that she has been living all this time in the same house with a woman who had deceived all the police , -- all the police , -- has been too much for her . i know it has been almost too much for me " . and yet , as lizzie at once understood , mrs . carbuncle knew nothing now which she had not known when she made her petition to be taken to portray . and this was the woman , too , who had borrowed her money last week , whom she had entertained for months at portray , and who had pretended to be her bosom-friend . " you are quite right in getting off to scotland as soon as possible , -- if they will let you go , " continued mrs . carbuncle . " of course you could not stay here . up to friday night it can be permitted ; but the servants had better wait upon you in your own rooms " .

0	how 's the wind ? she went into it to the windlass . he was smothered in an icy flood that seemed bent on wrenching him from his hold , but that was only for a moment or two , and then he was swung , gasping and streaming with water , high above the sea again . it was bad enough merely to hold on , but that was a very small share of his task , for the big black sail that cut the higher darkness came rattling down its stay and fell upon him and his companion bodily . as it dropped the wind took hold of the folds of it and buffeted them cruelly . this was a thing he had once been accustomed to , but as he clutched at the canvas it seemed to him incredible that he had not already been flung off headlong from the reeling spar . still , that banging , thrashing canvas must be mastered somehow , though it was snow-soaked and almost unyielding , and he clawed at it furiously with bleeding hands while twice the bowsprit raked a sea and dipped him waist-deep in . at length the other man flung him the end of the gasket , and they worked back carefully , leaving the sail lashed down , and scrambled aft to help the others who were making the big main-boom fast . when this was done wyllard fell against dampier and clutched at him .

0	i have found him ! but he spoke the words to himself , though even had he spoken them aloud maniel would not have heard . for maniel , for two hours , had closed his mind to everything that transpired outside his own thoughts , devoted to foiling the power of moyen .
0	you can , you may pass me the potatoes , and after i have finished eating you may play for us . we must show these scurvy ruffians that we are not a bit afraid of them .
0	i will tell you what it is , i have found out some things they do not want anybody to know , that 's what . i have found out what sort of folks they are , she and her brother . he 's a common -- let go of me ! by --

0	boat , ahoy ! the bay is full of islands , and little bobtail concluded to get under the lee of one of them , and wait for better weather . he took in his jib and mainsail , and the old boat went along very well , taking in very little water . the sun went down , and it was dark before he had made a harbor . he was approaching blank island , where he knew a good place to anchor for the night , when he discovered a large sail-boat , drifting down the bay . her sails were all lowered , but had not been secured , and were flapping about in the wind .
0	first rate ! first rate !
0	yes ; and that 's what you will not do , if you do not take care . but perhaps your idea of enjoyment is to make yourself wretched . there are lots of people like that , of course . " i must believe in things , " said jon with a sort of agony ; " we ' re all meant to enjoy life " .
0	i know you do . but you are prejudiced . i can not give up an old friend -- even for you , dick . he looked at her with some sternness , but his free hand closed at once upon hers . " i hate to think of you on terms of intimacy with that bounder , " he said .
0	at last you have come ! the tarasconian alone did not tremble .
0	revenge is sweet , " all right , " said billy . " i would like to show it to those wiseacres just to convince them that the thing was all right , and to get the laugh on them " .
0	good name , chow ! chow stared at it , goggle-eyed at the thought of such a contraption " coming to life " . " so that 's the ole think box , eh " ? he muttered .
0	sec a skrummidge ! " help ! help ! let me out ! quick , quick " ! came once more from within .
0	i doubt it , " it will be no business of hers , " said ronnie , angrily . " i can do as i choose with my own earnings " .
0	is that all ? well , so i am , measured by her standard , for i am neither a man of wealth nor an influential politician . but , thistledown , do not you think you are a bit foolish to let that trouble you ?
0	you will do no such thing , and please get out of that ridiculous habit of reducing my name to one syllable . if the people of the town can not help to support their own hospital , then they do not deserve to have one , and i ' m certainly not going to allow you to waste our money on that sort of nonsense .
0	no ; i did not know you were so fond of olaf . " it never occurred to you , then , that the meanest thing you could do to me was to marry olaf " ?
0	you have lied to me ! you speak our language , and yet you say you are but newly arrived . that must be a lie !
0	well ; yes ; -- not best of all , you know , there was no going to see the queen . that on the present occasion was done simply by mr . monk . but on the wednesday morning his name appeared in the list of the new cabinet as president of the council . he was perhaps a little fidgety , a little too anxious to employ himself and to be employed , a little too desirous of immediate work ; -- but still he was happy and gracious to those around him . " i suppose you like that particular office , " silverbridge said to him .
0	now , i will watch you start away from here , hemingway did not interfere , but , leaving his brother policeman at the river 's edge , accompanied young dodge . in a few minutes they arrived at the spot in the lane where dick had tied the horse . here they found dave darrin seated in the buggy . dave glanced unconcernedly at them all , nodding to hemingway way , who returned the salutation .
0	it _does_ sound jolly , faxon spoke up , he knew not why . " i was out there once : it 's a splendid life . i saw a fellow -- oh , a really _bad_ case -- who ' d been simply made over by it " .
0	oh , your aunt lilian would make little of the affair , she flirts with him herself .
0	i will not ! i have been and i have failed . i will never see the place again . i hate italy .
0	you win , your capacity will make you famous some day .
0	will your thousands amount to a clean million ? that is the amount , i believe , bequeathed by your wife to mr . auchincloss . nothing less will suffice . yet i thank you , ransom .

0	why does she tarry , then ? " my guest is equally anxious to meet mr . croyden , " miss carrington replied .
0	you get out of my bed , i will give you ten minutes to dress yourself and get out of my house . if you ' re not out by then , i will carry you out .
0	a week ! here 's my stomach already leaping like a fish at the smell of this hole . you brute bear ! it 's a smell of bones . it turns my inside with a spoon . may the devil seize you when you ' re sleeping ! you sha not go : i will tell you everything -- everything . i can not tell you anything more than i have told you . she gave me a cigarette -- there ! now you know : -- gave me a cigarette ; a cigarette . i smoked it -- there ! your faithful servant !
0	vive zhorzh vasinton ! somehow that day made itself strangely memorable to alice . she had been accustomed to stirring scenes and sudden changes of conditions ; but this was the first time that she had ever joined actively in a public movement of importance . then , too , long-hair 's picturesque and rudely dramatic reappearance affected her imagination with an indescribable force . moreover , the pathetic situation in the love affair between rene and adrienne had taken hold of her conscience with a disturbing grip . but the shadowy sense of impending events , of which she could form no idea , was behind it all . she had not heard of brandywine , or bunker hill , or lexington , or concord ; but something like a waft of their significance had blown through her mind . a great change was coming into her idyllic life . she was indistinctly aware of it , as we sometimes are of an approaching storm , while yet the sky is sweetly blue and serene . when she reached home the house was full of people to whom m . roussillon , in the gayest of moods , was dispensing wine and brandy .
0	it 's really too absurd , but i never can remember !
0	you ' re not in this , lollie , there was no escape that way . there was no help either from the nurses who were not nurses at all , nor from the maudlin little doctor , nor from the pretty girl who came sometimes and looked down on her with undisguised contempt -- or was it pity ? then one night she woke in a fright . two people were talking . she half turned her head and saw that pinto was in the room , and his face was a flaming fury . she had seen that look before , but now his rage was directed at somebody else , and with a start she recognised the pretty girl that the nurses called lollie .
0	why not ? " i am not so very much concerned about him , " remarked professor bumper , dryly .

0	truly said ; that is not a bad idea of your brother 's . my pasty is celebrated throughout all holland , and i have generally one ready in case a rich or renowned guest should desire it . but this pie is not for every man ! " madame , " said he , " allow me to remark that we have not dined . my brother , whose will is always mine , prefers taking his dinner in his own apartment , where he has more quiet comfort and can better enjoy your rare viands . he never dines at a table d ' hote . in every direction he has heard of your wonderful pie , and i come in his name to ask that you will be so good as to prepare one for his dinner to-day " .
0	oh , do not be such a silly , of course we are going to find something else . there 's the ocean and the palm trees . they say the scenery is perfectly gorgeous and the two big hotels wonderful , and there will be the crowds and crowds of people . and then we shall meet grace and walter --
0	well , she ai not , she 's just a good little woman that 's trying to do her duty as far as i can make out , and if she spends money you must remember she has only herself to support .

0	petronius a christian ! petronius an enemy of life and luxury ! be not foolish ; do not ask me to believe that , since i am ready not to believe anything . " now i understand why he defended the christians " .

0	mebby . what 's the difference ? " did not he say classic , huldah " ? inquired rob .
0	suppose we make it both . i will pay you wages , and besides give you one fifth of the net profits . " as my dad used to say , " replied noah ezekiel , skeptically , " ' faith is the substance of things hoped for ' ; and as i never hope for any substance , i ai not got no faith -- especially in profits . whenever i come round , profits hide out like a bunch of quails on a rainy day . i prefer wages " .
0	they seem to be greatly amused with something in there . " oh , i guess if it was the old lady , there would not be much question about it " .
0	more simple still , but how about the colored lights they saw ?
0	my husband has spoken , sir , surely , captain senby , you do not believe in mutiny .

0	i was just thinking of something of the sort , sir , and there 's another puzzle in my mind . have you any idea , sir , how these mexicans got the cases out of guarez 's barn in spite of your guard at that point ?
0	observe ! i should think so . you hardly waited till the minister had got through with us .
0	come back ! peter junior made no reply . he also rose , and taking up his crutch , turned toward the door . there he paused and looked back , with flashing eyes . his lip quivered , but he held himself quiet .

0	that is not a commonplace everyday occurrence to us , i assure you . the difference is that in this world of ours we can understand -- or at least explain -- these things as being scientific . and so they have not the terror of the supernatural . alten said , " you have a right to be overwrought , mistress mary atwood . but this thing is as strange to us as it is to you . i called that iron monster a robot . but it does not belong to our age : if it does i have never seen one such as you describe . and traveling through time -- "

0	can you see that , phil ? with extreme caution he made his way along the line of stumps , helping himself with the pick in one hand and the shovel in the other , until , about a hundred yards distant , he arrived at another hole where a tree had been rooted out , and here he went to work again . this time he kept at it for a good half hour , but at length he laid down his tools , and for a few minutes occupied himself by building with loose pieces of rock a little pillar about eighteen inches high .

0	as a medial man i could have no opinion on such a point unless i knew mr . tyke , and even then i should require to know the cases in which he was applied . " what i desire , " mr . bulstrode continued , looking still more serious , " is that mr . farebrother 's attendance at the hospital should be superseded by the appointment of a chaplain -- of mr . tyke , in fact -- and that no other spiritual aid should be called in " .
0	i looked up the time-tables ! my present knowledge of hampton is limited to the means and methods of getting away .

0	no , indeed ! by 1600 you could buy for a moderate sum a clock to use at home . not that it was a very accurate timekeeper . nevertheless it gave a fair idea of the hour , which was all that was demanded of it , " and all this time while clockmakers were fussing round about bobs and pendulums , did the people have to keep on running to the cathedral or the public square to find out what time it was " ?
0	you can , if you wish ; i do not speak their language , " tell that to the fishes , " snuffed wilde .

0	tommy , we ' re going round ! the river was growing narrower again , and swifter , too . on the last day , or night , of their journey -- though they did not know that it was to be their last -- it swirled so fiercely that it threatened every moment to overset their beetle-shells . suddenly tommy began to feel giddy . he gripped the side of his shell with his hand .

0	the allied commanders would give a good deal to know that , of course the thing the huns want to do above everything else is to separate and crush the allied armies . everything would be easy after that . but if they can not do that , they will probably make a break for paris . they figure that if they once got that in their hands the french would be ready to sue for peace . or they may try to take the channel ports , where they ' d be in good position to take a hack at england . the only thing that 's certain is that the drive is coming and when it does come it 's going to be the biggest fight in the history of the world .
0	but what 's the matter with him ? " _saperlipopette ! _ " he cried , and disappeared like a flash into the street .

0	come again , mr . eden ; glad to see you any time , martin was elated -- so elated that when he recollected that the hornet owed him fifteen dollars for " the peri and the pearl , " he decided forthwith to go and collect it . but the hornet was run by a set of clean- shaven , strapping young men , frank buccaneers who robbed everything and everybody , not excepting one another . after some breakage of the office furniture , the editor ( an ex-college athlete ) , ably assisted by the business manager , an advertising agent , and the porter , succeeded in removing martin from the office and in accelerating , by initial impulse , his descent of the first flight of stairs .
0	i cannot advise him . besides , he 's very staunch and owes these people much . " much would be forgiven him because he is a dearham , " mrs . halliday rejoined .

0	that is the difference between professional and amateur -- between nizam and redif -- between ahmed pasha and our esteemed but very youthful attach -- who has much yet to learn about that endless war called peace ! the next instant the princess came in to see what i was about so long , and she looked at izzet bey with a funny sort of smile , as though she had surprised him in mischief and was not angry , only amused . and when colonel izzet bowed , i saw how red his face had grown -- as red as his fez .

0	i felt strange in it myself at first , but of course i am accustomed to it now . the prince is not one who cares for state himself , but as one of his officers i was obliged to be well dressed ; and , indeed , this dress and the others i wear were made by his orders and presented to me . indeed i think i am very moderate in not decking myself out with the two gold chains i have -- the one a present from his highness , the other from the city of alkmaar -- to say nothing of the watch set with jewels that the prince gave me on leaving .

" leave me " . but nanna would not give over , tugging at the man 's weight until she had him to his feet again , with a convenient railing at his back . she picked up some water from the gutter with her hands held cup-wise , and dashed the liquid in his face . piers minor straightened up , and from his eyes the darkness cleared away .
0	oh , it 's quite simple . if you do not bump against a tree or fall into the creek you may be quite sure you ' re on the trail , " how can you find your way " ? asked mrs . bridges , to whom this was a mortally dangersome journey .
0	yes , you and james . and the message ended in this kiss .
0	well , some of it is not mine , i wish it were . this is only the makings , mrs . wade . wait a few years . now , here 's what we do . we have dinner at the hotel . afterward we drive out to the ranch where you are all to stay .
0	take care , you devil ! lest i have you in the police court for your words !
0	what did he say to that ? " well , according to bristow , we came back to him this winter -- not i , darcy , i do not make any pretence , " -- and he shook his head with slow gravity . " but i was interested in the revival on psychological grounds . i had never been so inside of one before . bristow is a good man , no doubt ; but it is just the one chosen way with him , -- strong crying and praying , and believing yourself a sinner above all men , and then a sudden peace and happiness , and a courage to endure , -- a blind , unreasoning courage to take the present as it is , because god sent it , and it must be for the best . boyd and whitlow and kenny were the great lights . they went about from house to house ; they exhorted and prayed . whitlow was one of the old bank-directors . strange to say , he did not lose a penny . his money was in government-bonds ; and now he has persuaded yerbury that if his advice had been taken there would have been no trouble . whitlow discharged his man this winter , and took in his place a half-grown boy . mrs . whitlow sets a good example to her class by discharging one handmaid and making the other do double duty . yet , so far as i can find , whitlow is a richer man than he was three years ago . kenny keeps his factory open , and gives the men three days ' work in the week , and pays them in poor shoes , as much as possible ; and takes out a good deal in high rent . boyd , who has the name of being the greatest saint of all , -- does what ? opens that miserable row of houses , that he could not let on any terms , and takes in tenants who are willing to work out the rent . he gets good prices , too . is he losing on them ? faugh ! the very term of charity makes me sick . and this winter he purchased a good deal of the stock of the relief-store . wretched flour ; miserable , adulterated stuff of tea ; pork , some of it that was not fit to eat ; and cheap butter , that every one would have been ten times better without . i went to him one day , red-hot , in a sanitary view of the business ; and he preached religion to me , -- his kind . ' boyd , ' said i , ' there 's keppler 's saloon , your own property , paying you a good income , no doubt , in these hard times , adding to the want and misery of yerbury faster than your whole church can save . if you are in earnest , go break up that den of iniquity ! ' "
0	you deserve to break the king 's back over the first cropper , do get up !
0	why , lord love you , sister , i will not worry if i never get it ! you pay me next fall , when you get your crop . . . . carrie ! suppose you or bea could shake up a cup of coffee and some cold lamb for the nelsons ? they got a long cold drive ahead . " i dunno ve can pay you yoost a little w ' ile , doctor " .
0	get out of this , get out of this . i can not attend to your hurts . do not come bothering here .
0	oats ! like horses ! but horses will eat meat , too , like you . as for me -- good bread , fresh cheese , a little salad , a drink of wine and water -- that is enough .
0	up-stairs , there ! the commander is here now .
0	no ! no ! no ! " i admit that your men have done the most of it , " answered the lieutenant , when the entire thirty riflemen had gathered near to hear the dispute ; " but if you are not willing to obey my orders , i can get along better without you than with you . if you desire to retire from the field , i have nothing more to say " .
0	i ' d like to sit on you , " let 's not attempt sarcasm , " he said crisply . " it sits ill upon you , mr . cornell " .
0	what a graceful bow ! you taught her that , i presume .
0	we ' re not winning , but we will ! confound that fog ! it 's coming up again ! " are we winning ? tell me , that we are winning " ! shouted dick in warner 's ear .
0	shut up ! i read _all_ the mail that comes here first .
0	i will na submit to ony sic indignity , " oh , my dear , good lady , do be quiet . you are in the hands of the law , which i believe you to be as innersent as the dove unborn ; but it will be the best for you to submit quietly , " said the housekeeper , who had hitherto sat in appalled silence , taking note of the proceedings .
0	you want it rough-house , do you ? bowers likes me to sing it more seriously , but it always makes me think about a story my grandmother used to tell . " that you must do again , " he declared when they finished this song . " you did it much better the other day . you accented it more , like a dance or a galop . how did you do it " ?
0	i was thoughtless ! i will do better , mother mine , i will go to her now and tell her so .
0	because you are piqued that he does not write , child . ah , dear , i know ! " i do not wish to hear anything about mr . henfrey 's love affairs " ! cried the girl petulantly . " i tell you that they do not interest me " .
0	my god ! my god ! " it is useless to think of help , no boat , nothing could live upon that fearful sea ; moreover , within five minutes this church must fall and vanish " .
0	well not from the direction of hail , i lived in chicago , but we were -- were not rich , and so i did not know the luxury of the city ; just the lonely , difficult part .
0	no , we ' re not ! we will beat ' em back . they can not run over us !
0	certainly not , sir ! " hell ! do you mean to tell me the whole damn thing 's goin ' to fizzle out this way , king ? i want something done , i tell you -- i want something done ! i did not bring you up here -- "
0	open fire at once ! the farther they have to come under fire the less they will like it .
0	i fear not , to make money .
0	sixty-six ! no more than yours is -- they are both sixty-sixes when you play tricks with them , and turn them up like that ; but they are both ninety-nines when you look at them fair .
0	do you surrender ? for another two hour 's the conflict continued . jack saw that the fire of the defenders of the wagons was decreasing , and he was not surprised when a white handkerchief was raised on the top of a bayonet and waved in the air in token of desire to parley . a shout of exultation rose from the spaniards . the priest showed himself on the hillside .
0	well , it is evident dick harding is the same old dick , all right . three years and getting married do not seem to have changed him a particle , " p . s . do you still read mary jane holmes " ?
0	moral -- do not venture out after sunset ! " abduction , maybe , " macloud suggested . " some night a black cloth will be thrown over your head , you will be tossed into a cab -- i mean , an automobile -- and borne off for ransom like charlie ross of fading memory " .
0	the century before the last ? thank you ! if i ask you about some of the ladies it can not be then that i may hope , as such a specimen of the rococo , to please them .
0	the fiesta is to be to-night , eh ? have you this engineer locked up yet ?
0	open the door and let him out , how can i recognize a man through a deal door ?
0	i do not want you , " ai not that just me ? i ai not had a day 's luck since lincoln was shot . the minute i get a good job along you come and spoil it " .
0	i can not take that exposition back with me , and i can take this contract . i think i will camp with my bid . " you can do your figuring there just as well as here , " said he . " i do not want your trip from chicago to be altogether wasted , mr . mitchell " .
0	jim will come in as soon as possible , after hearing that sound , drawing a small horn from one of his side pockets , mr . ross blew a long , shrill blast .
0	it is so nice of you to put it that way , under other conditions , you know , we might even have been friends .
0	what 's doing now , boy ? duff and his men fought to hold their places , but they became conscious of a steady pressure backwards .
0	my grandfather is not living , dr . hurlbut , " miss withers , miss withers ? -- oh , silence withers , -- lives up at the poplars . how 's the deacon , miss withers " ? [ ob . 1810. ]

0	put forth the bridge ! " saint taffy and saint guenhyfar " ! said the warder .
0	you do not , you may have an idea about where they should be placed , but it 's different every evening .
0	the art of making yourself agreeable never comes amiss , miss kronborg . i should say you rather need a little practice along that line . when you come to marketing your wares in the world , a little smoothness goes farther than a great deal of talent sometimes . if you happen to be cursed with a real talent , then you have got to be very smooth indeed , or you will never get your money back . bowers grimaced good-humoredly at her over the three checks he was pinning together . he liked to play at a rough game of banter with her . he flattered himself that he had made her harsher than she was when she first came to him ; that he had got off a little of the sugar-coating harsanyi always put on his pupils .
0	our m . p end_sentence_quote s are rather a mixed lot , monsieur pujol . " i have mixed much in english society , since i was a child , " replied aristide , in his grandest manner . " fortune has made me know many of your county families and members of parliament " .
0	now , where on earth did you get that idea ? " but gentlemen should not be expected to work -- at least , not hard , " argued algy ferrers .
0	what do you say to that ? i had a tank holding two hundred gallons put in the loft , and so now we shall have water .
0	oh , i always call him that , and he hates it , " georgie-porgie " ?
0	nonsense ! what are you talkin ' about ? ' twa not you she said . ' twas that howard swab . he 's been hangin ' around lulie for more ' n a year .
0	because i felt that we had been in school about as long as we could stand on the day of the championship game , " if you did not want to practice , what were you in such a hurry to get out of school for " ? demanded holmes .
0	forget it ! that 's not for you ! you have got your orders ! stay here !
0	you ' d get tired . madge , as she lay there holding mrs . flippin 's hand , looked very young , almost like a little girl . her hair was parted and the burnished braids lay heavy on her lovely neck . her thin fine gown left her arms bare . " mrs . flippin , " she said , " i wish i could live here always , and have you come every night and sit and hold my hand " .
0	i am not going around with a chip on my shoulder , looking for somebody to knock it off , i just want joe to leave us alone -- that 's all .
0	hold on , keep your shirts on . that man belongs to me . i caught him an ' i brought him here . d ' ye think i brought him all the way here to be lynched ? not on your life . i could ' a ' done that myself when i found him . i brought him here for a fair an ' impartial trial , an ' by god , a fair an ' impartial trial he 's goin ' to get . he 's tied up safe an ' sound . chuck him in a bunk till morning , an ' we will hold the trial right here .
0	let him spy , i dare say he ' d like to be coming too . it 's slow work for those fellows , always hanging about doing nothing .
0	i know just how you feel , but that 's the insolence of the painter -- he puts on canvas what _he_ sees , not what his patron sees . the more money you pay for a portrait the more insolent the artist . " well , yes , i do not know but i am . i did not think it was going to look just that way . mr . congdon says blue shadows are under anybody 's ears in the light , but i can not see ' em on the captain , and i do see ' em in the picture ; that 's what gets me twisted . when i look at the picture i can not see nothin ' else " .
0	close down the hatch ! it is producing a draft , and that helps the fire along !
0	thanks , herr hauptmann , i am quite myself again .
0	yes ; and that 's what you will not do , if you do not take care . but perhaps your idea of enjoyment is to make yourself wretched . there are lots of people like that , of course . " i must believe in things , " said jon with a sort of agony ; " we ' re all meant to enjoy life " .
0	dear me , sally , does any thing happen that does not put you in mind of some verse in the bible ? " oh , i was so frightened when jim came in ! i thought he ' d be sure to say something to his mother that would spoil every thing . but the lord put it into raby 's head to go off in one of his great laughs at nothing , and that made us all laugh , and the first thing that came into my head was that verse , ' and a little child shall lead them end_sentence_quote "
0	dare ? they dare anything ! " i did not know they would dare " !
0	if i stand this , sir , i ' m d -- ! " undo his stays " ! continued the pitiless old gentleman . " fling some water in his face , miss sharp , or carry him upstairs : the dear creature 's fainting . poor victim ! carry him up ; he 's as light as a feather " !
0	kennedy ! desperate , mad , he snatched at the weapon , and turned the barrel toward his mouth .
0	exactly ; he will tell him things which it is good he should hear . " to tell the truth , " replied the contessina , hesitating , " i fear that my uncle does not share monsieur l ' abbe 's views " .
0	you said i drank too much champagne , john estridge ! do you remember ? estridge , very animated , and apparently happy , recalled to palla their last dinner together , and their dance .
0	follow me ! we shall soon find a regular stove !
0	help ! help ! police ! they are strangling me ! he calmly turned a switch .
0	good idea , rob , let us hope so ! at any rate we will do our best to get cameron and his sister to come to us . we want them , do not we ? " well , will not he have business to attend to " ?
0	it 's women we want , young women , middle-aged women , any sort of women who are anxious for steady work and good wages .
0	do you hear me , sir ? the man looked at the captain , then at the ship 's company , and then at the man seized up , but did not commence the punishment .
0	no . that 's not me . it 's only the armour in which i encase myself . i hope it does not offend you . i can always take it off . only -- i am not sure you ' d like that any better . " you ' re very sarcastic , " said juliet .
0	that 's one of the chances that we have to take , let 's see if we can not make it work .
0	hurrah ! " yes , as good as new . now , if you will go into the wheel-house , we will see what she will do " .

0	your affair ! when that girl is living under the church 's roof , eating the church 's bread !
0	now , rogers , you liar , i dare you , dare you , to tell these people here that i or any of our people have sold you a foot of land . i dare you !
0	by heavens ! i will not hear that again . i will not listen to it , i tell you . i ' m afraid to do it . i cannot do it . i cannot .
0	well , be sure and order that powder , and say , i will want the rest of those ore-sacks .
0	than she ? you ' d scarce need to be better , for surely that 's well enough . but you _are , _ one feels , as it happens , better ; because , splendid as she is , one doubts if she was good . it was all the while for milly as if lord mark had really had something other than this spoken pretext in view ; as if there were something he wanted to say to her and were only -- consciously yet not awkwardly , just delicately -- hanging fire . at the same time it was as if the thing had practically been said by the moment they came in sight of the picture ; since what it appeared to amount to was " do let a fellow who is not a fool take care of you a little " . the thing somehow , with the aid of the bronzino , was done ; it had not seemed to matter to her before if he were a fool or no ; but now , just where they were , she liked his not being ; and it was all moreover none the worse for coming back to something of the same sound as mrs . lowder 's so recent reminder . she too wished to take care of her -- and was not it , _ peu pr s_ what all the people with the kind eyes were wishing ? once more things melted together -- the beauty and the history and the facility and the splendid midsummer glow : it was a sort of magnificent maximum , the pink dawn of an apotheosis , coming so curiously soon . what in fact befell was that , as she afterwards made out , it was lord mark who said nothing in particular -- it was she herself who said all . she could not help that -- it came ; and the reason it came was that she found herself , for the first moment , looking at the mysterious portrait through tears . perhaps it was her tears that made it just then so strange and fair -- as wonderful as he had said : the face of a young woman , all magnificently drawn , down to the hands , and magnificently dressed ; a face almost livid in hue , yet handsome in sadness and crowned with a mass of hair rolled back and high , that must , before fading with time , have had a family resemblance to her own . the lady in question , at all events , with her slightly michaelangelesque squareness , her eyes of other days , her full lips , her long neck , her recorded jewels , her brocaded and wasted reds , was a very great personage -- only unaccompanied by a joy . and she was dead , dead , dead . milly recognised her exactly in words that had nothing to do with her . " i shall never be better than this " .
0	shall i have a shot at them ? he signalled full speed ahead and the motorboat sprang forward .
0	villain ! do you not see the tax-collector ?
0	i do not mind that , edward , " and at that very minute you , with a hard cold , were sitting out in that draughty shed smoking because she would not allow you to smoke in your own house " !
0	two for me -- one in each pocket ! " i have got three fat partridges , " said jack .
0	halloa , master ! you ' re not to be trusted on the box until you can handle your whip better ' n that .
0	oh , _don ' t_ say ' slick ' ! i do wish you would not use such countrified words .
0	eighty pounds ! eighty pounds , munro ! what d ' ye think of that ? everything that i have in this house is going to be of the best . why , look at this waiting-maid ! did you ever see a neater one ?
0	and that was the night you did not milk the cows till ten o ' clock , and if you keep me here much longer , supper will not be any earlier than it was that night .
0	but we will get wet , " and swim , too , part of the way , " added stallings .
0	i dare say she was afraid of disturbing you . she is a kind-hearted girl , i am sure , and she would remember that you have been ill , miss ethel . " but she pretended that she had been here earlier and was unable to make anyone hear . i did not like that . we are not rip van winkles , " said miss ethel crisply .
0	i am very glad you can , captain shivernock , for that is what we are in need of just now , and since we have meddled with your affairs in your absence , it is no more than right that we should explain the reason for doing so . a tin box , containing nearly fourteen hundred dollars in bills , and many valuable papers , was stolen from this room . three persons , jacob hasbrook , laud cavendish , and don john here , passed through the library when they left the house .
0	that is an abominable , malicious lie ! a good-for-nothing lie , say i ! for did you not long ago snivel and beg till i was forced to promise you to make a will , and in it declare hodge , my beloved husband , sole heir of all my goods and chattels , and bequeath to him everything i have scraped together in my virtuous and industrious life ?
0	you canting little monkey ! what have you been doing ? it was the strange man . he was admitted by nellie . he stalked up to donald , his face red with wrath , and dashed the letter and bills into his face , crumpled up into a ball .
0	' great minds ' , i sort of focused on that man myself after reading your report just now .
0	_he_ marry ! thus thought anthon under the tree , and thus he thought many a night in the little lonely chamber of the wooden house in the " small houses ' street , " in copenhagen , whither his rich master had sent him , having stipulated that he was not to marry .
0	what can you mean ? " good-night , " answered the patroon , a sparkle in his eyes . " i was truly a booby " .
0	of course , how stupid of me -- a nice gable roof , a sloping roof that the rain runs off beautifully . oh , i can see that this is going to be awfully jolly -- just like camping out . you know how i love camping out . and you have a piano , too .
0	i demand satisfaction ! apologize , or fight !
0	you will try cases again , in front of judges , do not get me angry with you , maragon .
0	and does that make it any better ? mrs . brook looked intelligent and wan about it , but also perfectly good-humoured . " my dear man , he and his affairs are such twaddle " !
0	then -- " i will " .
0	was that your plan ? " i suppose you know you must never check a child 's natural ambitions " ! mr . linton told her gravely .
0	i believe he ' th feared o ' her , or he wudny-un went thae lamb-like !
0	you go out o ' that , bill ! dolly looked , and saw for the first time that the nameless farm-labourer was crouching under the beech , his browns and yellows blending with the bark behind him .
0	had not you better go down to them engines ? " very good , " said the engineer , as he followed him on deck and staggered to the side . " i have had enough o ' you lot " .
0	there 's a battery behind -- here it comes ! -- we ought to have started last night . the general said he must develop the forces of the enemy -- the aide was shouting , so that he might be heard through the uproar . " where are the guns ? colonel hatch says for the good lord 's sake hurry them up ! hell 's broke loose and occupied middletown . ashby 's there , and they say jackson ! they have planted guns -- they have strung thousands of men behind stone fences -- they ' re using our own wagons for breastworks ! the cavalry was trying to get past . listen to that " !
0	amusement ! riding is not an amusement ; it 's a necessity . the horse is our street car and railroad and steamboat . where you think city blocks and squares we think miles ; and where you think miles we think hundreds of miles . two legs are not enough in this country , so we double the number and go on four . you will find yourself wishing for eight before you get back from the king 's basin .
0	ca not think of a man on this base i ' d rather turn carolyn over to . " i was glad to see her , colonel " .
0	it may be , but , my good juan , we christians do not see eye to eye with you . this man rebelled against your government , but , also , he suffered for the true faith . he is a good catholic ; he has suffered for it ; and in the ever faithful island , that is a passport . he has climbed very high ; he is a judge of the marine court at havana . that is why he is here to-day , attending my uncle in this affair of delivering up the pirates . my uncle loves him very much . o ' brien was at first my uncle 's clerk , and my uncle made him a _juez_ , and he is also the intendant of my uncle 's estates , and he has a great influence in my uncle 's town of rio medio . i tell you , if you come to visit us , it will be as well to be on good terms with the se or juez o ' brien . my uncle is a very old man , and if i die before him , this o ' brien , i think , will end by marrying my cousin , because my poor uncle is very much in his hands . there are other pretenders , but they have little chance , because it is so very dangerous to come to my uncle 's town of rio medio , on account of this man 's intrigues and of his power with the populace . " then he 's a rebel , and ought to be hung , " i said .
0	you get away from here and tend to your own business , if you have got any , or i will heave a bunch of shingles at you ! " again i beg you , captain , with all respect , please may we come on board " ?
0	that 's our answah , sah ! goliday took his hand away from the butt of his ivory-handled gun . the texan had pulled his other revolver with the bewildering speed of a magician . goliday was covered , " plumb center " .

0	ah ! ah ! a mere youthful folly .
0	and is the party in honor of these new aborigines ? you did not explain in your note . merely you asked me to come , knowing that i cared not if it were a lawn fete or a ball , so long as i might again be with you .
0	too late ! mrs . roberts , too late ! she died in awful agony about twenty minutes ago . those two men in the hall whom you saw as you came in are the coroner and the doctor . oh ! my god ! my god ! pray , please pray for her soul , " is she living yet ? quick ! let me see her . this is the rev . mr . s -- who accompanies me , " i said .

0	what a fool of yourself with the whistle you ' d make ! for only consider how silly ' twould be to sit there and whistle for what you might take . " i would blow it again , " said the youth ; " and the charm would work so , that not even modesty 's check would be able to keep from my neck your white arm " . she smiled , and she laid her white arm round his neck . " yet once more i would blow , and the music divine would bring me a third time an exquisite bliss you would lay your fair cheek to this brown one of mine and your lips , stealing past it , would give me a kiss " .
0	no , i do not want a boy to fasten my dress in the back --

0	my dear sir richard , as i was saying to some one only the other day , an injured arm -- or leg for that matter , has often supplied a lack of courage before now .
0	because you have not magic brains , such brains as you have are of the common sort that grow in your heads , like weeds in a garden . i ' m sorry for you people who have to be born in order to be alive .
0	we look for the woman ! innes shook his head .
0	you have always got a fine vision for the dramatic . cigars were passed , and the men rose and strolled away . we wandered outside the gardens , passing the rejected guide as we did so . " i do not like the look in his eye , " said clovelly .

0	well , that 's a home question , sir . but i believe the mounseer is as poor as a man can be who makes no debts and does not actually starve . " poor , " said randal , turning back to gaze on the trim garden , the neat terrace , the pretty belvidere , and ( the door of the house being open ) catching a glimpse of the painted hall within , -- " poor ? the place seems well kept . what do you call poor , mr . bruce " ?
0	it 's all right now ! the effect was magical . the lantern came down , something that sounded like an attempt at words gurgled in his throat , and he made a signal to the other fisherman , whose attitude also changed instantly .
0	she a not so fond of her uncle as that , every day ! not that she a not a good nurse -- the kindest little soul you ' d meet of a winter 's walk ! she will read t ' ye , and make drinks , and sing , too , if ye likes it , and she will not be tired . a obstinate good ' un , she be ! bless her ! reluctantly the daughter of the royal navy glided away . her uncle 's head followed her to the door , where she dallied to catch a last impression of the young stranger 's lowering face , and darted through .
0	well , that 's the way to look at it , i suppose . think the thing you do is better than what anybody else does , and you ' re well started . " bigger-much bigger , " was the reply .
0	what 's that child doing here ? reif corrected him . " some thirty thousand tulans , all infantrymen " . he added , " and eight thousand allied cavalry only some of whom can be trusted " . reif 's ten-year-old son came up next to him and peered down at the map .
0	difficulties , there are none , unless you sit down and make them ; we do more difficult things than this every day of our lives : we passed the bridge of arcola in thirteen minutes ; and we had not the consent of the enemy , as we have yours -- have we not ?

0	hello , professor ! the searchlights pierced the vast heap of debris , and revealed the cluttered lane which had once been the town 's main street . carefully frank steered through the passage and came at last to a halt in front of the only four walls in the place that remained standing . here was the building in which they had discovered professor phineas borrodaile , living alone in primitive surroundings and trying to imagine him self a troglodyte .

0	a wonderful tailor ! how does he carry on business without writing letters ? she was herself again . " monsieur , " she said quietly ; " i know nothing of his past . i want to know nothing . it does not seem to me that it is my business . the world is free for a man to come and go in , if he keeps the law and does no ill -- is it not ? but , in any case , i know nothing . since you have said so much , i shall say this , and betray no ' secrets of his breast ' -- that he has received no letter through this office since the day he first came from vadrome mountain " .
0	go back to your rooms ! we want order here -- keep back ! " over there , " said another man . " come back inside , martha " . he shoved his wife back . " mr . haljan " ! he plucked at me as i went past .

0	that was quickly done , are all of you lads as quick on an errand as that ?
0	i see , what she ought not !

0	go on , keep your eyes on the spot , and for heaven 's sake , paddle !
0	stop , young biggs ! or i will break every bone in your infernal scoundrelly skin !
0	a poor tavern ; cold sleeping there , mahommed . " from the pyramid of maydoum , effendi , " was the quiet reply .
0	now hold on to her ! i shall not be gone long !
0	i know she is a very long-suffering person , do you recall the white mice you had once , laurie , and how they got loose and ran all over the house ?
0	we will not be driven back ! we want to see the beautiful mistress -- we want to see her close by .
0	oh , i will back you against the field . " nothing . that 's just it . what do you say in the street -- freeze ? well , she is trying to freeze me out " .
0	set the pan down , willie . " yes , ruin " ! william was hotly emphatic , " if you do not do something with her it will all be ruined before miss pr -- before they even get here " !
0	did not own it ! what nonsense are you talking ? the land belonged to my father , samuel kendrick , and i inherited it from him .
0	quite right ! but you are sure the cab is from the yard ? i have had painful experience of strange cabs recently !
0	i want to tell you , madam , that no member of my household --
0	quick , sir -- quick ! the unknown possesses unique terrors ; and since i was unable to conceive what manner of thing this could be , which , extending its incredibly long arms , now sought the throat of the man upon the bed , i tasted of that sort of terror which ordinarily one knows only in dreams .
0	adopt ? a boy of ten talking about adopting somebody else !
0	stretchers ! their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling , the hussars hastily dismounted , not knowing what they were to do . the men were crossing themselves . rostov no longer looked at the colonel , he had no time . he was afraid of falling behind the hussars , so much afraid that his heart stood still . his hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly 's charge , and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud . denisov rode past him , leaning back and shouting something . rostov saw nothing but the hussars running all around him , their spurs catching and their sabers clattering .
0	a fixed idea , eh ? " oh , that 's a way of hers . she 's quite obstinate when she gets an idea into her head " .

0	but he did -- he _did_ , it is just that . i hurt him a hundred times a day ; he never said so , but i knew it ; and yet i _couldn ' t_ be kind to him , -- except in words , -- and he understood . and after you came it was worse in one way , for he knew -- i _felt_ he knew -- that i loved you . his eyes used to follow me like a dog 's , and i was stabbed with remorse , and i tried to be good to him , but i could not .
0	do not be a kicker , danny boy , and just think ! when you get home , if any one asks you if you have been in paris , you can say ' yes end_sentence_quote should any one ask you if you have seen genoa , you can hold up your head and declare that you have .
0	with her ! do you mean to say ? that is a poor return for the hospitality which was shown to you by my parents and of which you formally sang the praises . i am a good-natured fellow and will submit to more from you than from any other man -- i know not why , myself ; -- but in a matter like this i do not understand a joke ! my sister is the only daughter of the noblest and richest house in corinth and has many suitors . she is in no respect inferior to the child of your own parents , and i should like to know what you would say if i made so bold as to compare the proud lucretia with this poor little thing , who carries water like a serving-maid .
0	ah , you have heard ? the door was flung open . the young man who had followed joan and alec into the louvre that morning rushed in . his pink and white face was crimson now , and his manner that of unmeasured , almost uncontrollable excitement . he gazed at them with a wildness that bordered on frenzy , yet it was clear that their own marked agitation was only what he expected to find .
0	oho-ho ! truly , friend ki , you are the first of magicians , save those prophets of the israelites who have brought you -- whither have they brought you , friend ki ?
0	h ' yah ! you young imp ! watcha think you are -- a fire-eater , for gosh sake ?
0	welcome back , lindsay ! we could hardly believe our eyes , when we saw you come down to the canoe . we have been in a terrible fright about you . the natives brought off news that the escort that had been sent down to take you to johore were , every one , killed ; and that , as there were no signs of any of your party , it was certain that you had been carried off . we sent a boat ashore , every morning , armed to the teeth ; but they reported that the place was almost entirely deserted , and the two or three men left there said that no news , whatever , had been received of you .
0	why , my dear , it was nothing but a harmless new york flat -- seven rooms and a bath . " no . that was the most frightful thing about it ; it had no mouth " .
0	on the contrary , it 's most amusing -- like the penny novelettes they sell in england .
0	we do not use such big words out here , ma ' am . just a hold-up -- a perfectly legitimate one , from bleyer 's viewpoint -- and it would have left me broke . " why , that is highway robbery " .
0	hue-e-e ! hit 's rasba , the riveh prophet rasba ! did yo ' all git to catch nelia crele , parson ?
0	you are not an amateur , and yours was the worst yet .
0	that 's all very well ! " i ' m sure -- " she began .
0	i demand an explanation , long otto raised a massive boot and aimed it at the animal , which , dodging with a yelp , cannoned against the second cat and had its nose scratched . piercing shrieks cleft the air .
0	look around you , doc . take a good gaze . " your caretaker sleeps here , i perceive " .
0	pull , boys , pull ! up she comes ! now , all together !
0	after me ! one of us has got to reach that lever while the creature 's still there to shield us !
0	you will go as i say , unfortunately , the law does not permit me to enjoy any cruel or unusual punishments , or i ' d insist upon your ninety-day sentence and watch you die painfully . i -- bailiff ! remove this menace before i forget my position here and find myself in contempt of the law i have sworn to uphold . i cannot be impartial before a man who contaminates my court with the world 's most dangerous disease !
0	you seem to be rather depressed , a few minutes later frank was walking slowly toward holborn .
0	you fool ! you have got that outer arm loaded down with material ' way beyond the margin of safety . you damned fool , you made an error here in the figures -- over the bottom-chords and posts . they will hold anything , once the suspension span is completed , but now ! lord ! mcgraw is a mule -- he will insist on a written order . weather report says wind . and another train loading to run out on the overhang , when we ought to be hauling steel off !
0	i could not make it just now , " that remark might be made , daisy , about every condition of life with which i am acquainted " .
0	i do not wish to fit in ; things must fit me . " goth ! goth ! my friend the valet ! cadet , you ' re a wonderful fellow , but you will never fit in quite " .
0	which shows you ' re clever just the same , imagine being able to speak in spanish and knowing some of the indian dialects as well .

0	where is my cur ? cursing and raging , the chauffeur clattered downstairs and collided with the hotel-keeper .
0	no offense , philippi , but would it be indiscreet to ask which side of your face hurts the most when you smile ? " you can not crowd in here , so you might as well move on , " declared philippi gruffly . " this is no hotel " .
0	what did your mother say to that ? " ' you have one daughter who has done the grand marriage stunt and she 's some class . do let us choose for ourselves " .
0	oh , do not bother , please . i ' m quite all right -- just a bit of a breather -- that 's all . you see -- i ran for it . safer , i thought . i could have done for the beggars , if i ' d had a heavier stick , but i did not want to make a rumpus . you see , i did well in putting the thing on paper . the ambassador nodded and then quickly , " give him a drink , otway " . and then as the other moved across the room to obey , " you were attacked -- in the street " ?
0	afraid ! i am afraid of nothing on earth . i am the greatest matador in spain . with this right hand i have killed nine hundred and fifty-seven bulls .
0	i ' m thinking of doing that very thing , but i ' m glad i found the rose in that queer old waste-basket first .
0	damn you all , you cowardly counter-jumping scoundrels ! what do you mean by setting on one man in that way ? hit out , sir -- hit out right and left ! i saw you insulted ; and i ' m coming to help you !
0	i can imagine him . but if he has tried it with you i should think he ' d be converted .

0	they came to me -- at the moment , " those names -- where did you get them " ? she queried .
0	no ; let 's not get into that kind of trouble . you do not carry a gun anyhow , do you ? " shall i shoot on sight " ? demanded the little old man .
0	to hear father talk , you would think that the present generation is no earthly good ! yet i suppose , when he was young , his elders held the same opinion of him .
0	i almost made a whole poem about you , chapter twenty-five
0	why do not you arrest that villain ? " no , toupillier , " said the little old man ; " you have not been robbed ; i came here in time to prevent it ; nothing has been taken " .
0	but you have seen all our pretty frocks , it 's only strangers we can hope to impress with them now . i shall wear my most captivating gown , if mr . collins is coming . is he , ad le ?
0	we did that here in 1861 . " they have lost their grip on patriotism " .
0	no , no ! are you mad ? who 's that asking for a light ?
0	how many years have you had in the sash , door and blind business ? " i have the necessary ability , " replied jimmy , " to manage your business " .
0	leave the room ! leave the room ! how dare you talk like that before me-e-ee !
0	yes , and i have noticed something else . you are apt to fall in love with the rebel .
0	i will have ' im put back , " i ' m damned if it is . you moved it since i was here " .
0	well , as far as i can see there is absolutely nothing wrong with it , get in , girls , and i will start the engine -- or try to . then if she will not go we will have to make up our minds to stay here all night or walk to the next garage .
0	james ! stop that talk at once !
0	by god , gourlay , i will make you pay for this ; i will fight you through a ' the law courts in breetain , but you will implement your bond .
0	how then did you get into the stable ? it was evident that he lied ; evident , too , that he had little hope from his lie . uneasiness was taking the place of confidence in his youthful , untried , undisciplined mind . carmel had spoken to him in the hall -- i guessed it then , i knew it afterward -- and he thought to deceive this court and blindfold a jury , whose attention had been drawn to this point by his own counsel .
0	you need not speak so regretfully , but here our people come .
0	pelicans ! you have been round the world , and will you turn back from westward-ho ?
0	we are ruined , hopelessly ruined ! they will drive us from our last possession , they will turn us out of our house ! all the misfortunes of the whole world break over and crush us !
0	i will settle with you in the morning , jackson , " damn you " ! cried the old man , qualifying the oath , " let me get at you , you great big sock-stealer , i will make you hop high ! i will snatch you bald-headed so quick that you will think you never had any hair " !
0	me wash dishes ! i never did anything like that in my life !
0	and for a part of it , that will be diamonds for you , will not it ? lulu 's eyes sparkled . " i ' m ever so glad for papa " ! she said ; " he 's just the right person to have a great deal of money , for he will be sure to make the very best use of it " .
0	i warned you not to use psi in the game ! now you will have to talk to pete .
0	mind you do not have any of the gintlemen throwing stones at you , dinny , " then there are some good big fish , anyhow , " said dinny ; and he went off some fifty or sixty yards to where the narrow little stream ran at the bottom of rather a steep declivity .
0	well , not half , but i love it . i ' d rather play elizabeth myself than any other part i know , and so i ' m just crazy glad that catherine 's going to do it . miss marlowe did not want to give catherine another heavy part after being viola and she tried helen and esther , but they simply could not do it . catherine is too sweet for words . you should hear her say to mr . collins , ' do not consider me now as an elegant female , intending to plague you ! ' catherine an elegant female ! mr . collins is simply killing . i do hope eleanor will be careful of the coat -- it 's really too tight for her .
0	killed ! o , mamma , i would not have one of my pets killed for any thing .
0	no , no ! i ' m wanti not ' stay .
0	oh , i know ! the usual thing . things seem to be going on all right . it must not run too smoothly .
0	right again , " why , yes , " prescott answered slowly . " duty is the main thing there is about life , is not it " ?
0	sure thing , that wise old crow 's the guilty thief !
0	all right , i will dive first , maaster jasper .
0	a la plus jolie femme du monde ! half a dozen riotous frenchmen in the box opposite jumped to their feet and waved their goblets at clifford .
0	i thought of that , i gave my age as twenty-one .
0	we ' d soon know who ' d told tales , " and you need not go sneaking , either , or it will be the worse for you , " added minna jennings .
0	why not ? " hush " ! admonished mother wit . " do not let her hear you " .
0	she 's a courageous ruth , is not she ? " i ' d love to be with arline , " returned ruth bravely , " but i can not afford it , and i can not accept help from any one . i must work out my own problem in my own way . you understand , do not you " ? she looked appealingly from one to the other of her friends , who nodded sympathetically .
0	we have got to stop ' em ! it was a desperate chance , but one that had to be taken . bud knew , if the others did not , that about a mile beyond lay a gully , led up to by a cliff , and if the steers and cows reached this , the leaders unable to stop , while the rear ranks pushed on , there would be a mass of piled-up , dead cattle to tell the story .
0	nick ! i put my hand to my mouth .
0	will you not understand ? " i will not , " said the philosopher . " many of the insectivora also practice this custom . ants , for example , are a respectable race living in well-ordered communities . they have attained to a most complex and artificial civilization , and will frequently adventure far afield on colonising or other expeditions from whence they return with a rich booty of aphides and other stock , who thenceforward become the servants and domestic creatures of the republic . as they neither kill nor eat their captives , this practice will be termed kidnapping . the same may be said of bees , a hardy and industrious race living in hexagonal cells which are very difficult to make . sometimes , on lacking a queen of their own , they have been observed to abduct one from a less powerful neighbour , and use her for their own purposes without shame , mercy , or remorse " .
0	that is quite another story , and such a long one that were i to tell it to you now it would mean you would get no sailing or swimming to-day .
0	my friends ! a boy stood in the doorway -- a shrinking , timid , brown-eyed young oriental , very dark of skin , very white of teeth , very black of hair -- a slim youth of eighteen , possibly twenty , in a shabby blue suit , broken shoes , and a celluloid collar . twisting between nervous brown fingers , not as clean as they might have been , was a tissue-paper package .
0	and you ' re pretty big , but edmund is taller than you , and broader-shouldered .
0	why , at the last general election one of the spaikers , i doan ' know who ' twas , but the one that talked tariff reform , zaid that the germans was a lot better off than we be . he zaid that the germans was fat , and that we was lean , and that the germans had better times , shorter hours , and higher wages than we have got . ef tha 's so , we ' d be a lot better off under the germans than we be now .
0	or in the _het jagertje_ , " here we are , all on the raging canal " ! said terrill to his captain , as the team started . " if it comes on to blow , we can take a reef in the forward horse " .
0	you cannot be serious in saying this , i am sure ? mr . collingwood told helen that if she still agreed to his conditions , he would arrange with mr . james , the solicitor , that all the money left to her by her uncle should be appropriated to the payment of his debts . " but , " continued he , " pause and consider well , whether you can do without this money , which is still yours ; you are , you know , not bound by any promise , and it is not yet too late to say you have altered your decision " .
0	o , he 's only loafing , and wants to see a yankee ship and a yankee crew , " he has made his canoe fast astern , as though he meant to stay here some time " .

0	she means abnormally , abdominally smart , oh , my !
0	very true , my solemn peggy , but you should not know it . and if we do not like ' crittersizers , ' then do not let 's criticise . it was my besetting sin , peggy , and it took me a long time to learn we all have rubbish in us , and it was not a bit hard to see the ugly things in people . and unless we can rake the rubbish out and get rid of it , it does not do much good to talk about it . people used to make me so / mad ! /
0	she does not feel the heat the way i do , " nancy 's a sport , " he pointed out to caroline enthusiastically , " no fly in the ointment gets her goat . she enjoys herself even when she 's perfectly miserable " .
0	that must have been a good while ago , before chicago was a big place . " i knew dr . lindsay when he was filling prescriptions on madison street , " she said spitefully .
0	a little danger , only adds to the fun .
0	i _must_ compensate myself somehow , " very well ! then you gain seven francs and a half upon those who pay you fifteen francs " .
0	jessie , come out ' ere , martha pulled down her sleeves and went to the inner door .
0	enough , enough ! " i will , " was the answer , and on the instant a horrible shriek rent the air . jimmie had quickly grasped both of the professor 's arms at the wrists and was slowly twisting them in a grip of iron . kell 's face went white , the lips writhed back over toothless gums , the eyes closed in the supreme effort to withstand the excruciating pain . then --
0	great country , jombateeste ! " and beautiful ! you do not know what a good-looking town is till you strike paris . and they ' re proud of it , too . every man acts as if he owned it . they have had the statue of alsace in that place de la concorde of yours , mr . whitwell , where they had the guillotine all draped in black ever since the war with germany ; and they mean to have her back , some day " .
0	prophesying , eh ? all right ; we will see .

0	i will defend this land ! the last sauk shaman this side of the great river held up his knife so the sun glinted from it .
0	good for you ! you ' d make a first-rate boss ' round here ; guess i will have to give you a raise .
0	look ! my projectile went part way through and then carried the plate with it into the side of the hill . talk about a powerful explosive ! i have struck it , all right !
0	say , what the devil 's the matter with you to-day ? dennis just called me up about that herring order --
0	hi ! here ! some of you , look after these things , will you , and get us a cab . i tell you what , tom , you have got to come up home with me first , and we can have dinner there ; then i will come on to your den , and we can pack our knapsacks and sleep , and then start by the five train to-morrow morning .
0	mr . burns , do not ! raising the manuscript , which represented all that the past months of his re-created life had meant to him , and grasping it in both hands , he shook it contemptuously , as he said , with indescribable bitterness and the reckless surrendering of every hope : " ' all them fine things that i have wrote down for everybody ter read end_sentence_quote " he mimicked her voice with a sneer , and laughed again . then : " it 's all a lie , judy , dear ; -- a damned lie . auntie sue is a saint , and believes it . she made me believe it for a little while , -- her beautiful , impossible dream-philosophy of the river . the river , -- hell ! -- the river is as treacherous and cruel and false and tricky and crooked as life itself ! and i am as warped and twisted in mind and soul as you are in body , judy , dear . neither of us can help it . we were made that way by the river . to hell with the whole impossible mess of things " ! with a gesture of violent rage , he turned toward the river , and , taking a step forward , lifted the manuscript high above his head .

0	i will be right behind you , so keep moving !
0	do not underestimate my intelligence , i understand you , it is a fortunate thing for me that you are not a secret agent . my occupation would be gone .
0	pee-wee 's right and we ' re wrong , as he usually is , " you ' d have to have a crowbar , " westy said .
0	you ' re as bad as durkin ! wonder why he called him ' penny , ' by the way . the fellow had a regular second-hand shop down there , did not he ? do you suppose all that truck in there belonged to him ?

0	shut her off ! bumpety-bump , -bump-bump ! the tree , uprooted from the gap side by the rain and the wind , had descried half a circle , it seemed , when shifted by the pilot . its big end had rolled under the coach . from the feeling the young engineer could guess what had happened .
0	oh , he 's on the outside ! " or monsieur felix marchand 's side , " she interrupted meaningly .
0	my fee shall be commensurate with my inexperience , and are you thinking for a moment that i would let my first case get away from me at all ? as for the danger -- well , i ' m an irishman .
0	oh , i ' m glad they ' re coming , all i hope is that nothing will happen to keep them from coming to-night .
0	if you can get three things as wonderful as these , i will give you my head . a little dwarf , named brok , was standing near by . he heard loki say that . then he stepped up and said , " my brother can make just as good things as these " .

" silver threads among the gold " was the favorite -- especially with lottie . she would dance and clap her hands when she felt the vibration of certain minor chords , and come running to the visitors and attract their attention to the sounds that she could " hear " .

0	i was interested in the man . he told us a good deal about himself , although it would have embarrassed him if he ' d guessed . the curious thing is that he imagines he 's practical , while he 's really a reckless sentimentalist .

0	you see , i am fate , and stronger than your puny plans ; and i am how-things-turn-out and i am different from your little dreams , and i am the flight of time and the end of beauty and unfulfilled desire ; all the accidents and imperceptions and the little minutes that shape the crucial hours are mine . i am the exception that proves no rules , the limits of your control , the condiment in the dish of life .

0	as for instance , the meal over , the breakfast things were put away in the bag , sam and bill took puddin ' between them , and all set off along the road , enlivening the way with song and story . bill regaled them with portions of the " ballad of the salt junk sarah , " which is one of those songs that go on for ever . its great advantage , as bill remarked , was that as it had not got an ending it did not need a beginning , so you could start it anywhere .
0	do you remember the day you showed me how the indian women carried so much on their backs , in these nets ? i did not think then i would use it so soon . but it hurts my forehead , alessandro . it is not the weight , but the strings cut . i could not have carried them much farther ! he bounded like a deer , crying , " my senorita ! my senorita ! can that be you ? to think that you have brought these heavy loads " !

0	here , you leave that alone : that 's not our flag , and if you string it up , we will string you up , bagosh ! he dropped it the full length of the staff , whipped it off the string , and put his foot upon it . then he unrolled the bundle which he had carried under his arm . it was the british flag . he slipped it upon the string , and was about to haul it up , when the drunken orator on the platform caught him by the arm with fiery courage .

0	yes . i am a little tired . it has been a hard day .

0	perhaps never , never , never any other . that , i confess i should like to think . only ours .
0	oh , yes , several were more or less bruised and one man had an arm broken . but everybody was thankful , for they said it might have been much worse . but it certainly was funny to see those chickens scattering in every direction over the snow-covered fields , " then nobody was hurt " ?

0	the old ship 's bound to have good luck ! this is only the beginning ! we will sweep the seas of every hun !
0	why , it 's nothing . and i do not know whether i should like to . he tried to get something out of the notion , but nothing came of it that mrs . milray thought possible . she said , across her husband , on whose further side she had sunk into a chair , that they must have something very informal ; everybody must do what they could , separately . " i know you can do anything you like , clementina . ca not you play something , or sing " ? at clementina 's look of utter denial , she added , desperately , " or dance something ?

0	forgive me for saying that you will not feel so bitterly toward him when the time comes for him to name your baby . " i do not care what it all comes to , madame obosky , " she said , a red spot in each cheek . " he shall not name that baby " .
0	an appetite like yours only makes it worse to be broke , " i have my appetite , " insisted gamble with a grin . his cheeks were ruddy and his skin as flawless as a babe 's , and his eyes -- exceptionally large -- were as clear as they were direct .
0	i ' m afraid he was not interested , i doubt he even knows that it happened .
0	from what you said just now , i gather that the penalty is expulsion from the town ! if i understand legal procedure , i should have been brought before the justice of the peace -- who happens to be another company store-clerk . instead of that , i am sentenced by the mayor -- or is it the company superintendent ? may i ask how that comes to be ? " you will find out when the penalty is exacted of you " .

0	why , woods is easy ! the rockland crowd was delighted .
0	milligan ! the man reached back and jammed killigrew 's hat down over his eyes . killigrew stumbled and fell , and crawford and forbes surged to his rescue from the trampling feet . thomas , however , caught the ruffian 's right wrist , jammed it scientifically against the man 's chest , took him by the throat and bore him back , savagely and relentlessly . the crowd , packed as it was , gave ground . with an oath the man struck . thomas struck back , accurately . instantly the circle widened . a fight outside was always more interesting than one inside the ropes . a blow ripped open thomas ' shirt . it became a slam-bang affair . thomas knocked his man down just as a burly policeman arrived . naturally , he caught hold of thomas and called for assistance . the wrong man first is the invariable rule of the new york police .
0	i am awake ! i am awake ! _gospodar_ , observe me ! i am awake !
0	what has been the matter aboard ? i gave a cry of horror and disgust . it attracted the attention of my shipmates . we now looked along the deck . in several places were other dark clotted marks scarcely yet dry . other signs there were which showed that plunder had been the object of the deadly attack , which , it was evident , had been made on the crew of the brig . articles of dress were strewed about , and cases of provisions , nautical instruments , books and charts , and opened bales of merchandise ; but there were no signs of a struggle -- nothing to show that the hapless crew had even been enabled to fight for their lives .
0	i believe you are locking yourself up to get drunk , massy listened . instead of passing on to the bathroom where he should have gone to clean himself , the second entered his cabin , which was next door . mr . massy jumped up and waited . suddenly he heard the lock snap in there . he rushed out and gave a violent kick to the door .
0	here he comes ! here comes the man with a snake in his bosom !

0	do not fire , it is a pity to kill the old fellow for defending his wives . how would you like it ?

0	if it 's hiding we will find it , hip , hip and a couple of hurrahs for p . harris , scout !
0	yes , let her go , if she had been a decent woman --
0	it will do for want of a better one , anyway , ' " i certainly have , " admitted larry . " and that probably explains why that stage scenery did not kill me outright . it 's been rather a mystery to me why it did not , but you have put me wise to the real reason " .
0	very well , if i can persuade him , i will .
0	oh ! hell , binks , i have got it bad -- right where the boxer puts the sleep dope . . . . i think i will just go and wash my hands , old boy ; they strike me as being unpleasantly excited . . . .
0	you ungrateful boy ! will nothing suit you ? when i say you look like the best man i know , you gave a shrug , and when i liken you to a great poet , you shout . i ' m afraid you are very conceited , mac . it certainly did amuse him , for he lay back on the hay and laughed so heartily that his merriment scared the squirrel on the wall and woke dulce .
0	that sounds to me as if it might be dangerous doctrine . " did mr . rash ever notice that goin ' to the bad , as ' e calls it , ai not the syme for them as ' ave nothink as it looks to them as ' ave everythink ? when you ' re ' ungry for food you heats the first thing you can lie your ' ands on ; and when you ' re ' ungry for life you do the first thing as will promise you the good you ' re lookin ' for . what people like you and me is hapt to call goin ' to the bad ai not mostly no more than a ' ankerin ' for good which nothink do not seem to feed " .
0	mutiny , by jove ! marines , fix bayonets ! run that scoundrel through .

0	one no-account horse to show for a week 's hard work ! at supper douglas gave the details of the hunt , which were greeted by the family with considerable hilarity .
0	not if i know myself ! you may be a fool , but --
0	duck him ! with a howl they projected themselves upon him . juan 's grin changed instantly to an expression of great concern . he went down under their charge , with four boys , instead of three , on top of him .
0	where do you think you two are going ? get those suits off and get outta here .
0	get things through ? i should say not , " yes , sir , " said wickes , his face pale and his fingers trembling . " i do not -- i do not seem to be able to -- to -- get things through " .

0	you made her a little yourself . i have thought of her as looking like you . mrs . alsager reflected , looking down at the fire ; she had the air of having half-a-dozen reasons to choose from . but the one she produced was unexpectedly simple ; it might even have been prompted by despair at not finding others . " i like her because you made her " ! she exclaimed with a laugh , moving again away from her companion .
0	go to hell , will you ? you ' re on my land .
0	thoughts like that just come to her . it 's what you might call inspiration , or intuition , and bet , as she put away the indian costume the next morning , hugged it to her as if it had been responsible for the whole affair . " whatever made you think of it , bet " ? asked enid .
0	look out or i will poison you ! " i call it a mean idea , " morgan pursued . " but i shall punish you by the way i hang on " .

0	well , do not be so polite about it ! -- i will see you to- morrow ?
0	i ' m in the hands of my friends , " what do you say miss burnaby ? will you brave the discomforts of a shack in the dry belt " ?
0	what for ? " yes ; let 's turn off to the left , " shouted dick ; and as if by one impulse they wheeled round to the left , and galloped on over the plain . " i tell you what , " he cried , as a happy idea struck him ; " let 's wheel round to the right now " .
0	what 's the matter , you born iddiwut ? " oh , lor ' , do not ! oh , please do not ! i shill die quick enough now without that " ! cried taters , writhing horribly .
0	my word , but this is funny ! here are the boys , who were looking for us , and instead of rescuing us we have captured them . let go that line and let ' em up !
0	and well he had reason ! " he was jealous " ?
0	the ol ' thing shook me till my teeth rattled ! soon the ladies heard jim henderson halsey bawling loudly , and his sister backing away from the buttery while she continued making faces at the angry help . the little girl 's protruded tongue made sary rush at her with uplifted palm , but both youngsters were so accustomed to dodging these attacks , that they reached the haven of mrs . halsey 's presence without a painful encounter .
0	thirty-five years ! i declare , it still makes me jump to hear about thirty-five years -- just as if i had not known all about ' em ! you do not say it 's thirty-five years , lucy ! i guess you ' re right , though .
0	it is not easy to enter that place , juanino . " ah , juan mio , " he said , " spain is not like your england , unchanging and stable . the party who reign to-day do not love me , and they are masters in cuba as in spain . but in his province my uncle rules alone . there i shall be safe " . he was condescending to roll some cigarettes for tomas , whose wooden hand incommoded him , and he tossed a fragment of tobacco to the wind with a laugh . " in jamaica there is a merchant , a se or ramon ; i have letters to him , and he shall find me a conveyance to rio medio , my uncle 's town . he is an _quliado_ " .

0	a woman and her mirror , what tales each might tell of the other , if they would !
0	it was by no means necessary from so excellent a friend . recollections of former days came over me ; and i hastily asked him if he had obtained mr . thomas john 's signature .

0	why not ? is there any particular reason why they should not look like us ? venus and earth are very nearly the same size , and are planets of the same parent sun . physical conditions here appear to be very similar to conditions back home , and if there 's anything to svend arrehenius ' theory of life spores being sent from world to world by sunlight , there 's no reason why humanoid races cannot be found throughout the universe . on worlds , that is , suitable for the development of such life forms .
0	yes , the flanton dog , what do you think became of him ?

0	would i have risked appearing before you , if i still reckoned myself of the roman catholic church ? catharine parr is hailed by the protestants of england as the new patroness of the persecuted doctrine , and already the romish priests hurl their anathemas against you , and execrate you and your dangerous presence here . and you ask me , whether i am an adherent of that church which maligns and damns you ? you ask me whether i believe in the pope , who has laid the king under an interdict -- the king , who is not only my lord and master , but also the husband of my precious and noble catharine ? oh , queen , you love me not when you can address such a question to me .

0	do not you think , mrs . fletcher , that it is a good sign of the times , that so many people who make money rapidly are disposed to use it philanthropically ? " saints or sinners , it does not make much difference to me , " now put in mrs . fletcher , who was evidently considering the question from a practical point of view , " what a man professes , if he founds a hospital for indigent women out of the dividends that i never received " .

0	jump for your lives , boys ! festing moved a pace or two and went on talking , but charnock fixed his eyes on the snow . the part above the track overhung the gap in a bulging cornice , as if it was moving down hill , and in a few moments a heavier shower began . the bulge got more prominent , but the cornice did not break off , and while he watched it , wondering whether he should call out the men , a stone fell from the wall and dropped at his feet . this was ominous , but next moment a mass of snow struck his head , nearly knocking him down , and when he recovered his balance and wiped his face he noted with alarm that the stones were opening and the big post leaned outwards .
0	you sinner , if you will not take my word for it i will smash you . " you do not get ' prenticed for nothing , " was the faithless rejoinder .

0	i really mean , my dear signor ferrari , that , being always accustomed to have my own way , i can make no exception in favor of ladies , however fascinating they may be . i have business in naples -- it claims my first and best attention . when it is transacted i may possibly try a few frivolities for a change -- at present i am unfit for the society of the fair sex -- an old battered traveler as you see , brusque , and unaccustomed to polite lying . but i promise you i will practice suave manners and a court bow for the countess when i can spare time to call upon her . in the meanwhile i trust to you to make her a suitable and graceful apology for my non-appearance .

0	that 's very nice , bob ; but how much are you thinking about me and how much about yourself ? " no " ! he resumed ; " it 's too big a sacrifice ! you like people about you and would see nobody but me and the hired man , while i admit i ' m enough to jar a woman 's nerves . then think of the work ; the manual work . you could not live as the bachelors live among dust and dirt , and it 's a big undertaking to keep a homestead clean when you can not get proper help . besides , there 's the baking , cooking , and washing , while you have done nothing but superintend . i ' d hate to see you worn and tired , and you know you ' re not so patient then . i get slack if things go wrong , and if i slouched about , brooding , when i ought to be at work , it would make you worse " .

0	you are quite right in one way , mrs westonley , but wrong in another . i should have come to ocho rios six months ago , but all our horses died from eating poison bush , and it was only a few weeks ago that my mates and i were able to buy some from a drover , who was taking a mob down to cooktown . " i am so glad to meet you at last , mr aulain , " said mrs westonley , as the two men entered the cool sitting-room . " tom has a just grievance against you for not coming to see him when you were only eighty miles from us . almost every day for the past year he has been expecting to see you . but i suppose that washing out gold is too fascinating a pursuit , and that you could not drag yourself away " .
0	we do not do business that way . but i guess i can promise to keep the bag till you come back , if you hurry . " well , will you do a little gamble ? keep it till i come in , and if i take it i will pay eight hundred . if i do not , you can have twenty-five dollars interest on your time " .

0	we shall be delighted to come if you will ask us , guy mangler had only three minutes to reestablish an interrupted acquaintance with our young lady . he reminded her that he had danced with her the year before , and he mentioned that he knew her brother . his mother had lately been to see old mrs . tramore , but this he did not mention , not being aware of it . that visit had produced , on lady maresfield 's part , a private crisis , engendered ideas . one of them was that the grandmother in hill street had really forgiven the wilful girl much more than she admitted . another was that there would still be some money for rose when the others should come into theirs . still another was that the others would come into theirs at no distant date ; the old lady was so visibly going to pieces . there were several more besides , as for instance that rose had already fifteen hundred a year from her father . the figure had been betrayed in hill street ; it was part of the proof of mrs . tramore 's decrepitude . then there was an equal amount that her mother had to dispose of and on which the girl could absolutely count , though of course it might involve much waiting , as the mother , a person of gross insensibility , evidently would not die of cold-shouldering . equally definite , to do it justice , was the conception that rose was in truth remarkably good looking , and that what she had undertaken to do showed , and would show even should it fail , cleverness of the right sort . cleverness of the right sort was exactly the quality that lady maresfield prefigured as indispensable in a young lady to whom she should marry her second son , over whose own deficiencies she flung the veil of a maternal theory that his cleverness was of a sort that was wrong . those who knew him less well were content to wish that he might not conceal it for such a scruple . this enumeration of his mother 's views does not exhaust the list , and it was in obedience to one too profound to be uttered even by the historian that , after a very brief delay , she decided to move across the crowded lobby . her daughter bessie was the only one with her ; maggie was dining with the vaughan-veseys , and fanny was not of an age . mrs . tramore the younger showed only an admirable back -- her face was to her old gentleman -- and bessie had drifted to some other people ; so that it was comparatively easy for lady maresfield to say to rose , in a moment : " my dear child , are you never coming to see us " ?
0	what shall we do with this boy ? to begin with , if he is what he says , no doubt he has some money with him . " a frank question and a bold one " ! the leader laughed . " what say you , men ? whom are we for just at present ? we were for the imperialists the other day , but now they have marched away , and as it may be the swedes will be coming in this direction , i fancy that we shall soon find ourselves on the side of the new religion " .
0	that 's not so -- i do not believe you ! you must have money , and i have got to get some . i have been begging from a lot of fellows who played ball with me , but they all turned me down . now you ' re doing the same thing . you ' d better be careful . i ' m a desperate man !

0	the lectures had a checkered existence , many very amusing incidents centered about them . were i to talk until doomsday i could not begin to tell you the multitudinous adventures mr . bell and mr . watson had during their platform career ; for although mr . watson was never really before the footlights as mr . bell was , he was an indispensable part of the show , -- the power behind the scenes , the man at the other end of the wire , who furnished the lecture hall with such stunts as would not only convince an audience but also entertain them . it was a dull , thankless position , perhaps , to be so far removed from the excitement and glamor , to be always playing or singing into a little wooden box and never catching a glimpse of the fun that was going on at the other end of the line ; but since mr . watson was a rather shy person it is possible he was quite as well pleased . after all , it was mr . bell whom everybody wanted to see and of course mr . watson understood this . therefore he was quite content to act his modest r le and not only gather together at his end of the wire cornet soloists , electric organs , brass bands , or whatever startling novelties the occasion demanded , but talk or sing himself . the shyest of men can sometimes out-herod herod if not obliged to face their listeners in person . as watson had spoken so much over the telephone , he was thoroughly accustomed to it and played the parts assigned him far better than more gifted but less practically trained soloists did . it always amused him intensely after he had bellowed _pull for the shore_ , _hold the fort_ or _yankee doodle_ into the transmitter to hear the applause that followed his efforts . probably singing before a large company was about the last thing tom watson expected his electrical career would lead him into . had he been told that such a fate awaited him , he would doubtless have jeered at the prophecy . but here he was , singing away with all his lung power , before a great hall full of people and not minding it in the least ; nay , i rather think he may have enjoyed it . once , desiring to give a finer touch than usual to the entertainment , mr . bell hired a professional singer ; but this soloist had never used a telephone and although he possessed the art of singing he was not able to get it across the wire . no one in the lecture hall could hear him . mr . bell promptly summoned watson ( who was doubtless congratulating himself on being off duty ) to render _hold the fort_ in his customary lusty fashion . after this mr . watson became the star soloist and no more singers were engaged .
0	yes , i wore them out . i have gone into a legitimate business .
0	volunteers have done good service at the cape before now , sir , and have shown over and over again that a man can fight just as well in plain clothes as if he were buttoned up to the chin in uniform ; and as the boers are themselves nothing but volunteers , i should think that before this war is over the war office will see its mistake . " i think that it is just as well that you should go , chris , " the officer said ; " and indeed i was on the point of telling you that we are all leaving . for myself i cannot understand why the cavalry should be kept here , and indeed i know that it is their opinion also , and that they have asked the general to let them leave . however , he has decided to keep them . i am sure it is a mistake . before the siege is over forage is sure to run short , and half the cavalry will be dismounted before the end comes . however , i have seen him and pointed out that as scouts we should be useless here . he has given me leave to go , but has requested me to join the first troops that come up the line . when we are once away i shall give you leave to act altogether independently of us , which will i am sure suit you better than being kept for weeks perhaps at colenso or estcourt . another thing i will do . general yule was speaking to me only yesterday of the manner in which your party defeated and cut up more than double your number , and how you and three of your party went into the boer camp at talana and ascertained their strength for general symons . i expect that general buller will come on here , as it is certainly the most serious point at present . i will ask yule to give you a letter of introduction to him , it will be useful ; and i have no doubt that he will give you a free hand , as i have done . i should not call upon general buller in that rig-out , if i were you . i have heard he is somewhat of a martinet at the war office , and we know that they have a very poor opinion of volunteers there " .

0	come on , boys ; now for it ! land her for me and i will show you wonders you never even dreamed of !
0	what is it they say out there ? they call words of blasphemy , that the bull is germany , and ' judas ' will ride it to the death ! they are wild barbarians , they are --
0	you would not have thought so , if you could have seen how they fought the first caps and aprons we tried to get them to wear . they _were_ homely things , even if they were life savers . so we kept at it till we got something so trim and pretty that the girls would rather wear it than not .
0	questionable that -- at least at present . whatever i may be , i am just now the lad that drives your father 's cart , and works in your father 's tan-yard -- john halifax , and very much at your service , mr . phineas fletcher . " that 's right ; i ' m so glad . nevertheless " -- and i watched him as he stood , his foot planted firmly , no easy feat on the shifting bark-heap , his head erect , and his mouth close , but smiling -- " nevertheless , john , it 's my opinion that you might be anything you liked " .
0	all right , then , we ' re going to be torpedoed . now , i hope that satisfies you .
0	pardon me ! being unused to such exercise , my blade fell by mistake on your back .
0	you poor little beggar , it 's not often you get neglected . but it 's not often that bombshells in the shape of ordinary , simple , harmless-looking letters fall from the skies , scattering extraordinary contents and my wits along with them . here you are , you morsel of injured patience .
0	i ' m afraid you are , there is only one real detective in the world -- and that is jack o ' judgment !
0	in all likelihood you can discover the driver , and he will establish my alibi .
0	i doubt if your mother would consent to expose you to those conditions again . i will write to her and you may be the bearer of the message and plead your cause . " i ' m sure mother will consent . there certainly will not be the danger there was living among the indians " .
0	it does look that way . at all events we are to thank clara adams for it all . her club is founded on unkindness and if we want to be a rival , mrs . conway says we must have ours founded on kindness . " i should think that might be a good plan though i expect we shall all turn quakers if we continue the club " .
0	but i ' m not doing it any more . and there 's nothing courageous in that , " oh , but you are . i have heard all about you . we ' re very proud of you , my dear . very . you have been doing so well -- oh , i have heard -- and your striking out into business quite alone was about the most courageous thing i know of . why , the mere thought of such a thing takes my breath away " .
0	oh , yes you will ! it can not be that you ' re afraid of being caught . if anybody says so , i will swear i know better . you have nerve enough not to care for that . come around to-night . we will look for you .
0	you fool ! stop that ! we could not use their ship , anyhow !
0	varney , the vampyre ! i see him about half-way down clinging , like a fly , to the wall . odd zounds ! i never saw the like afore !
0	here ! here ! " ahoy there ! where are you " ?
0	you have not got me , i said , " if it was not for warde hollister i ' d take him into my patrol . i have got every kind of a freak in there now except a ghost " .
0	we can not wait for you , you ' re too slow , " plenty of room , " added mr . blaisdell .
0	look out ; he 's wiping them off ! but you see he did not wipe mine off .
0	nothing is easier , madame . a cavalier , charged with an important mission , had come an hour before your arrival , seeking hospitality , at the very moment that the cure , summoned to the bedside of a dying person , left not only his house but the village , for the entire night . the priest having all confidence in his guest , who , besides , was a nobleman , had left to him his house , his supper and his chamber . and therefore marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbe and not from the good abbe himself . " monsieur " ! cried the duchess , seizing athos 's hands , " tell me this moment how you know all these details , or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you " .
0	then why are you here , you rascal ? " nothing , your majesty ! i have done nothing at all , " answered pon in a faltering voice . " she does not love me any more and even refuses to speak to me " .
0	i never saw a clever young professional man without a theory ! " so much the more need of a physician ! herbert , i am not the least uneasy on the subject of infection ! i have a theory for its annihilation " .
0	ma-arya ! " let her alone , " the old man persuaded him ; " let her alone . she is a harmless woman . it 's a sin " .
0	stop , i beg of you ! oh , my ! larkspur , grab the hose ! knock that rascal down ! why do not somebody do something ?
0	got long eyes ? i do not know as they ' re any longer than mine .
0	splendid ! ca not we will them to want our house in town , and invite us to visit them ?
0	ah , i ' m afraid ' pursuit , ' with me , is over .
0	you mean for a place on the stage . that is not work . _you_ could not work . i can see that at a glance . " i ' m looking for work " .
0	the opposite of the way we came , a tide brought us into this bay . the same tide on the turn would carry us out of the bay . to be sure , the wind may have had much to do with our direction , but it is only fair to suppose that if we came down the east coast of kadiak on an ebb we would go up that same coast on the flood . at least , if we could do no better , we would be leaving a place where no word seems apt to get to us .
0	i ' m busy ! see me tomorrow !
0	oh doctor , the bit o ' comfort ! it ud never do me no harm .
0	well , do you expect a girl to be saying the one thing always ? " sakes alive , kirry , " cried nancy , " is it yourself it was ? what were you saying a week ago " ?
0	o god , what have i done ! again the weakness and the blackness came stealing over her ; she sank down on the doorstep .
0	and , too , i knew who you were , of course . i did not know for certain how you stood , or how much you could do , but you looked good . and it was pretty obvious you had capabilities . " maybe i ' m stupid , but i ' m not that stupid . the reason i was rough on you was the fact i did not want you signing any statements that pete had hypnotized -- or what would you call it -- you . that would have fixed the whole thing and they ' d have had him " . he coughed .
0	ah , they are young -- life does not seem long to them , does it , elizabeth ? " cedric thinks she is perfect . i wish you could have seen his letter : he is rapturously happy . and anna writes so sweetly : she says it seems like a dream ; that she can hardly believe in her happiness ; that she does not deserve it , and that cedric is everything that she could desire " .
0	a devil 's plague upon him ! and the lying hypocrite ever crosses my path , by gad 's life ! i will tear his gown from his back !
0	be still , shelton , or i will have them gag you .
0	surely . their snarling , biting , and endless battle is a nuisance . we should knock them both on the head .
0	cold ? " lord " bill seemed to liven up under the influence of speed . the wind was howling now , and conversation was impossible , except in short , jerky sentences . they were on the high level of the prairie and were getting the full benefit of the open sweep of country .
0	a mosquito bit me , leach paid the bill to captain patterdale -- you say ?
0	she 's more than cast a shoe , then ? so we must tackle horses to her , eh ? ' get a horse ! ' horse power is surer than gasoline i have always believed .
0	the south ! oh , hear the child ! she thinks derbyshire is in the south !
0	well , they will do to hew firewood and cut meat , " those arkansas and texas fellows have got knives that would make a malay 's blood run cold " .
0	yes , this afternoon , you need not worry about your little billy . neither the police nor the japs have captured him . he is improving his chance to pursue the avocation of book salesman .
0	yes , you said it to me , and i can tell you , patty , it had the real society ring ! you said it like a conventionalised parrot .
0	a great many people think that , but it is not so .
0	that 's what we came for , " hello , uncle bill ! come in " .
0	she is like a design for a poster ! " she wears tiger-skin shoes " ! whispered one .
0	a rebold ribald rowdy ! " hear ! hear ! hear " ! interrupted mabel . " remember that famous song , ' i know a girl and her name was jane ' " !
0	i ' m going to move out a couple of stones , so betty will not beat my record , " and i ' m sure i never could do it , " remarked amy . " do let the boys manage it , bet . the lads who own the canoe will be glad of the chance " .
0	it is better to chat upon such matters when one is quite alone , but he talks to you about it with the door shut , for no man in russia can be sure that his own servants are not police spies . i was discussing politics with a russian official one evening in his study when his old housekeeper entered the room -- a soft-eyed grey-haired woman who had been in his service over eight years , and whose position in the household was almost that of a friend . he stopped abruptly and changed the conversation . so soon as the door was closed behind her again , he explained himself .
0	oh , dear . and you , too , we can not leave you out of the picture . being of more mature years i guess you ' d sweep in -- that 's the way -- sweep in gowned -- at your age you do not dance around in ' frocks ' -- in something swell , and rich , and of sober hue . oh , dear , oh , dear . guess we ' d have to match your mahogany face . wine color , eh ? no ' cute little bows for you . just beads and bugles , whatever they are . but we ' d let you play around with some tinted mixing of powder for your nose , or -- or we ' d sure spoil the picture to death . my , i ' d die laughing .
0	that was bad , no doubt , but if it had been a horse you would be in the hospital-tent now with some of your ribs broken , if you had not been smashed up altogether .
0	we will lose him anyhow , i have seen it coming , although you could not . i will break ramon for this .
0	did you get orders , too ? just then he noticed siddons come from around the corner of the hangar , carrying what appeared to be a canvas covered pillow . seeing mcgee 's plane on the line he stopped in surprise , then proceeded to his plane , where he fitted the pillow into the seat , patting it in place as a woman pats a divan pillow . then he came across to the side of mcgee 's plane .
0	you ' re our business , git up an ' dust out o ' foxville , you dirty loafer !
0	i love to hear you say that , it means so much to me . do not think i have not a sense of proportion . i have . in all this universal slaughter and massacre , a woman 's life counts as much as that of a mosquito . but to the woman herself , her own life can not help being of some value . such as it is , i want to give it all , every bit of it , to willie . he shall have everything , everything , everything that i can give him .
0	i quite forget what i said , was it all very bad ?
0	mr . ellery , ahoy ! it was captain zeb mayo who was calling . the captain sat in his antique chaise , drawn by the antique white horse , and was hailing the parsonage through a speaking trumpet formed by holding both his big hands before his mouth . the reins he had tucked between the edge of the dashboard and the whip socket . if he had thrown them on the ground he would still have been perfectly safe , with that horse .
0	never mind , doughnuts , nobody can deny that you did your best , after you have had a little practice with this crowd , i will back you against their champion eater any day .
0	do not worry , i have not far to go . if you will look to the right there you will see the lights of a little town . i shall be able to get a conveyance there for my homeward journey . i brought you this way because it will save time and trouble .
0	halt ! say that again in half the words .
0	you do not put no such stuff as this over , i tell you ! this here 's a free country , and you call yourself a debating society , do you ? lemme tell you _i_ belong to a debating society in chicago , where i come from , and them fellas up there , they ' d think they ' d oughta be shot fer a fake like what you people are tryin ' to put over , here , to-night . i come down here to git some more education , and pay fer it , too , in good hard money i have made sweatin ' in a machine shop up there in chicago ; but if _this_ is the kind of education i ' m a-gunna git , i better go on back there . you call this a square debate , do you ?
0	once a week to you , tom , " how about writing to me " ? shouted tom .
0	_caramba_ , but i will see him myself ! ana started after him , and seized his arm . a scuffle ensued , and ricardo 's voice was loud and shrill as they reached the stairs . the woman clung to him desperately . " ricardo -- anything you ask -- double the amount , if you will go ! leave the house -- i will tell the padre -- i will give him the letter -- "
0	to-day ! " we have already lighted our fires , and our sailors are weighing the anchors . will twelve o ' clock suit you " ?
0	oh , i see ! but , after all , i suppose --
0	somewheres towards midnight , miss . we ' re a-goin ' through it middling smart , and we can always draw on them . at last she turned , and said , " when do you think we shall sight them " ?
0	but , vicomte , you must remember that you are in america , and that you have come here to study our manners and customs .
0	myself excepted , for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours .
0	yes , adding lustre to the ranks . i came upon him yesterday cutting wood for his mess . ' why do not you make jeames cut the wood ? ' i asked . ' why , ' said he , ' you see it hurts his pride -- and , beside , some one must cook . jeames cooks end_sentence_quote i left him getting up his load and hurrying off to roll call . phoebus apollo swincking for mars ! -- i was at greenwood the other day . they all sent you their love .

0	glory ! " it 's worse than ever . breckenridge 's men are swarming out of their works . there seems to be a myriad of them . they cover the whole hillside until i can not see the ground . they yell like demons , and drive our men down into the river . they follow them to the water 's edge and shoot them down in the stream . ah , there goes a battery on the gallop to the hill in front of us . it has opened on the rebels , and its shells dig great holes in the black masses , but the rebels still come on . there goes another battery on the gallop . it has opened . there is another . still another . they are galloping over here from every direction " .
0	that bad boy , gyp , has took it , it was in vain that blanche told her that a new doll would be as dear as the old one , the little girl refused to play , and her cherub face looked very sad , the dimples failing to show , because the smiles would not appear .
0	holloa , _amigos_ ! we are losing the glorious sea-breeze . _vamanos ! _ let us take a stroll to the tiger 's trap .
0	time will tell , all of you fellows must admit that he has sand .
0	oh , we ' re all right ! but what i want to know is what you are doing out so late every night since you have come home , and where you were gone for the past week ?
0	that 's good , now i can stay . if you had not believed me , i ' d have had to go . and i do not want to do that -- not yet .
0	a woman never could whistle , but that call seems to do for the dog , all right .
0	uncle harry , you crawl on your hands and knees and play you was a horse , and i will ride on your back .
0	yachts in sight ! this was exciting news , and sam rodman walked rapidly to the companion-way of the penobscot .
0	never you mind , i guess i know --
0	perhaps i ' m not altogether so simple . " old stephen " ! she cried with the note of a mother . " they will worry you in politics " .
0	good ! another one , aten .

0	there it is again ! oh , mamma , mamma , come in my room quick !
0	trust me ! do you suppose i ' d have unfastened it if i could not fasten it up again ? i just keep the hook in a certain position with my knife , as i close the door , and then gently drop it into the ring through the crack . i have done it a dozen times . leroy danforth taught us how .
0	he is going to be , as soon as his poem is printed . the girl did not go further into her family history ; but by one of those leaps which seem to women as logical as other progressions , she arrived at asking , " is mr . burnamy one of the contributors " ?
0	yes ; i missed my calling , " well , you ' re a doctor , not an undertaker , anyhow , " she reminded him .
0	ice ! big pack of it right under your weather bow .
0	sold again , giglamps ! i did not think we could carry out the joke so far , i wonder if this will be hoax the last for mr . verdant green ?
0	stop there ! another step and i -- i --
0	i wish i knew he was -- and damned , " aye , " grumbled marius , " you can contemplate that , and it is all you do contemplate . you will not see , madame that our position is far from desperate ; that , after all , there may be no need to resist the king . it is three months since we had news of florimond . much may happen in three months when a man is warring . it may well be that he is dead " .
0	ah , you will have to give me satisfaction for this insult ! " yes , i confess that is exactly my intention " ! replied the prince , laughing .
0	oh , mother , i got a hundred !

0	ha ! ha ! cheer up , jack , " i think so . indeed , i am quite sure of it , " coolly replied the girl addressed . " but i really think it is quite useless " .
0	if god wills ! " and shall i make it bear other fruits as well as oranges " ?
0	some desert island , hey ? pee-wee looked up and beheld a boy seated comfortably in the branches of the tree . he was looking down through the profusion of blossoms with an exceedingly merry face , and had apparently been witnessing the arrival of the discoverer with silent amusement .
0	oh why did you say that ? now i have got to feel like a sneak or tell you -- and i did not want you to know .
0	oho ! you can be nicer than that to me , you know -- i ' m not ptitsin !
0	good heaven ! how many of ' em _are_ there in the trees ? again he fired .
0	it might be if you should really fall in love with him , " ' clem , ' he says . his other name i do not know . he would give me some outlandish cognomen if i should ask . but it is not of much consequence " .
0	not alive ? not alive !
0	hey ? " stop the press , " cried jack to the boy who was feeding the sheets . " stop the press ! this thing must not go in " !
0	guard all the windows , do not let them get away .
0	wake up ! wake up ! he rushed to their side and shook them , but he could not rouse them .
0	ca not do it ! " come on and play , hal ! you can have sanderson 's skates . he 's going home " .
0	do not do that ! it is not sportsmanlike , give the poor beast a chance .
0	i ' m afraid you have not got any patient , any more , doctor , " well " ! he cried , coming in , his face beaming . " there 's no need for me to ask how my patient 's doing " !
0	ready below there ? there , ma ' am , i have telegraphed down that you ' re coming !
0	well , i think he is -- he is everybody 's servant and friend . " is he one of your servants " ! she asked graeme in an undertone .
0	i did not , but it 's seven , now , it will be broad daylight in a few minutes more . move ! get a hustle on !
0	when i said that i was alone , i meant that i was alone in the land and not only alone in this stead . there is no house save this betwixt the sea and the dwellings of the bears , over the cliff-wall yonder , yea and a long way over it . said the master : " where be the other houses of the town " ?
0	yes , i ai not altered much -- . ' sides , what about her ?
0	sure it settles it , and besides , monday is columbus day -- and monday night , too . that 's a holiday .
0	the hell you ai not , i guess you will stand the gaff till you explain .
0	no ; but it might relieve my mind . " would it relieve your eye any " ? lightly .
0	this is not wholly imagination , you goose , for it 's based on a knowledge of human nature , as i have hinted . also it 's a scientific matching of the pieces in the puzzle . why , mary louise , in this deduction we have all the necessary elements of the usual crime . a woman -- always look for a woman in a mystery , my dear -- money , the cause of four-fifths of all crimes , and a guilty man who is afraid of being forced to disgorge his ill-gotten gains . then we will add an innocent girl who suffers through the machinations of others . some of my conclusions may not be exactly correct , but in the main the story is absolutely logical . mary louise drew a long breath . " if i could believe that theory , josie , " she said , " it would relieve me of much worry , for i ' d know alora is safe . but -- what was it your father said about your imagination " ?
0	five ! five ! i will cross my heart to die i never hear tell of you , or ever knew they was sich a man in the world !

0	you dear old jim , you talk as if you were a hundred . some day you will be in love yourself . then you will know what it is . do not look so sulky . surely you should be glad to think that , though you are going away , you leave me happier than i have ever been before . life has been hard for us both , terribly hard and difficult . but it will be different now . you are going to a new world , and i have found one . here are two chairs ; let us sit down and see the smart people go by . " sibyl , you are mad about him " .
0	so much good luck actually turned uncle ben 's head , why , he hardly knew what he went to the city for , and i had to guide him by the arm to show him the way to his office .
0	i am not going away , go and tell the lady whimsical that a great king , who has heard how charming and how gracious she is , would like to make himself known to her .
0	so i have heard , well , you boys may as well make yourselves at home .
0	to the telegraph ! " not yet , gentlemen ; but you are right ! we must have better information to go by . the telegraph must complete its information " .
0	i will not go , i will die with you .
0	what ! how dare you mock me ! i will report you .
0	citizen-captain , this is an outrage , if blood is shed , upon your own head be it .
0	and he said , ' _partons ensemble . comme on dit en anglais_ -- fly with me ! ' i remarked that our state when we got to the champs de mars would be an effective disguise . he did not understand , and it was delicious !
0	a truly delectable neighbor for a help to pleasant fancy , if the amiable devil should be moved to sacrifice now , i would be the nearest to his hand -- think you he would make ill use of my youth and tenderness ?
0	oh ! " let him wake ! the daddy will come across or i will wring the brat 's neck " !
0	read that ! by gad ! -- but we have been lucky ; every client of ours has had a chance to sell . if he would not do it , he has only himself to blame now .
0	you wild-hoss chaser , your wildfire may be a bloody killer , but he can not beat the king in a race !
0	oh ! no , it is not that bad a case , we ought to be able to handle things without going to such extremes . besides , you know , i carried a number of those stout sticks into the gym the other day , and william amused himself fastening a lot of cloth around them , so that they look like the stuffed club we used in the minstrel show last winter . william is just itching to use one on some poor wretch . perhaps he might get the chance to-night . so-long , jack .
0	then the last descendant of the ptolemies is blind ! rome may ignore his claims . but i will inform the emperor how dangerous a pretender this roof yet harbors .
0	what a joke if we find the old family castle is a nest of robbers , " i ' m puzzled , " said the consul , leaning back and looking at us all with half-closed eyes . " why should kagig choose just this time to guide a hunting party ? if any man knows trouble 's brewing , i suspect be surely does . anything can happen in the interior . i recall , for instance , a couple of danes , who went with a guide not long ago , and simply disappeared . there are outlaws everywhere , and it 's more than a theory that the public officials are in league with them " .
0	presently ? do you know what time it is ? how long are you going to stay out here ?
0	all right , we will forgive you this time .
0	say , i ' m sorry , we were just closing . duane and ralph entered quickly .
0	well , i declare , they looked for all the world like some farmer 's wife 's winter collection of herbs , tied up in small packages , and fastened in regular order along the different beams .
0	no , no tunnels there . the water would seep into them .
0	one can never tell , with _vous autres gens-de-lettres_ , " oh , how unkind of you " ! he cried . " it was absolutely extemporaneous " .
0	no , but i got it . why would the hackers have to be covering for themselves . could not they be working for someone else ?
0	then -- then we will stay here till the tide rises and dr-dr-drowns us ! " you can not wade . it 's too deep between the shore and the boat , " hiram said , calmly .
0	not that one , i will take nineteen for the other .
0	yes , i would rather be hungry than cold , any day . love , our one extravagance is certainly coals . a grand fire this ! i do like it so ! " john , if you have a weakness , it is for fire . you ' re a regular salamander " .
0	see , now , you think they are lost , and yet they have healthy stomachs ; so long as a man is hungry he will not die . " ah , yes , your majesty ; we have been hungry and thirsty a long time , " said grabow .
0	they are coming anew ! do not kill the boys ! take them alive , and they shall be of our faith .
0	you heard what our captain said , i always follow orders . if dick prescott tells me to pile up seven runs against the souths i ' m going to do it .
0	ran for your lives ! we ' re in the track , and will hardly escape as it is !
0	really , i hope it 's not owing to conscientious objections to tiepolo ?
0	your firm , your firm -- you have been cowards from the start . i know you , i know you . you have sold me out . crookes has bought you . get out of my way ! get out of my way ! do you hear ? i will play my hand alone from now on .
0	do not you talk about it ! i will take all the responsibility of that rope . it will hold all right . i looked at it the other day . all you have got to do is pull ! do you hear me ? pull as you never pulled before !
0	where are you going ? i sprang madly back from the rail . and smith had my arm in an iron grip .
0	whose fault , paul ? god made us . " tell me , " i asked -- " i loved her , knowing her : i was not blind . whose fault was it ? yours or hers " ?
0	you really did it very well . a sudden thud of pounding hoofs , a snatch of ragtime , and her foreman swept up in a cloud of white dust . his pony came from a gallop to an instant halt , and simultaneously mac landed beside her , one hand holding the wide-brimmed hat he had snatched off in his descent , the other hitched by a casual thumb to the belt of his chaps .
0	stop ; do not hurt me , and i will tell you all , sir , oh , sir , reginald morton was my husband once ; but he was kinder than you are . he did not look so fiercely at me ; nor did he pinch me so .
0	what ! am i to fight one against two ? is this your chivalry ?
0	no . only one of the right sort . the sort that makes fine sons . she has one already ; splendid little chap . the three of ' em are off to dalhousie early in may , and they have just persuaded me to spend my two months there instead of beyond kashmir . mrs desmond has a misguided notion that i am knocking myself to bits over my work in the interior . " a miraculous one , i should say , to have dragged such an adjective out of you " !
0	you did not suppose i could work ? i can , when i have to . and studying does not hit me very hard , although i ' d rather be out-doors .
0	look ! chicot gave him a crown , and asked for gorenflot .
0	i go through it twice a week . the trouble seems to be that she 's alive , and that she thinks everything greek is alive , too . " she struck me dumb , " said the professor . " i listened for the best part of an hour while she expounded things to me -- asked me questions i could not answer , mostly " . he chuckled a little . " i felt like a fool , " he added , frankly , " and it felt good " .
0	get into line as i showed you how ! rifles in the front rank , the others behind them . we ' re all right now ! keep firing !
0	oh , that will not be necessary , i say , fellows , it must have been a pretty stiff ordeal for randy to go by that fire , within sight of the man he peppered with salt .

0	one grows adaptable very quickly . i confess i am very happy here . certainly there are times when one feels rather as if one had dropped off the world into space , but it does not take long to struggle through it . but then , of course , it is well to remember that billy and i are rather an exceptional couple ; quite absurdly , idiotically satisfied with each other 's company . if it were not so our lives would be purgatory . the tragedies of these far countries are for the husbands and wives isolated from all other companionship , and having perhaps nothing in common with each other . there are few conditions worse than isolation under those circumstances . it breaks the woman 's spirit and sours the man and brings shipwreck , where a little other congenial companionship might have brought them through in safety . " and you " ? diana turned with a winsome air to ailsa grenville . " do you find the natives lovable , and the primitive conditions ? and are you proud of the mission farm ? or does not it all sometimes make you just long to scream ? it would me " !
0	well , cousin katy , i shall call you cousin , though you are not really my cousin .
0	she ' d say the same , she ' d tell me i was mighty slow if i could not get ahead o ' jim . why , when i was his age --
0	hell ! did not you frisk him ? " he made his break while i was ' phoning you , " he answered .
0	fill it again , " flowers " ! said the old sailor , tapping the ashes cut of his pipe against the heel of his boot . " and where ' d you get flowers in middle of the say ? it 's dhramin ' you are . come now -- to bed wid yiz " !
0	in ! in ! set it on fire ! death to cond 's friends ! even then i believe she would have stood her ground , but for marie 's evident terror . the poor girl could not conceal her dismay , and her eyes distended in fright as the hungry roar of the mob leaped from the street . those in front hacked at the barrier : those behind urged on their fellows with deep-mouthed baying .
0	come on ! we might be able to get him out . a mad fool like that 's just the kind who will live through it .
0	is that all , bab ? it sounds simple .
0	well ? " it 's about the ' erring , sir , " said joe , twisting his cap between his hands .
0	can you not reform him a little ? " maverick was growling about kilburn the other evening . it is a shame that he should sell such poor goods , when prices have come down a good deal " .
0	i ' m not going to let signs or omens trouble me . and i have not even changed my name , so the letter cannot count . and it is one of the good old salem names . it was my dear father 's . " ' change the name and not the letter , you marry for worse and not for better end_sentence_quote "
0	which one ? " your friend was here to-night , " remarked one to adele .
0	you do not mean to say you ate it ? his sister regarded him sharply .
0	i am detained here to watch for a russian spy who is trying to get through to the galician border . you ' re sure you ' re not -- ?
0	therein i recognize my prudent cousin , who dares not trust his promises to writing . but i thank him for his golden answer . how much did you say you brought , conrad ? " no , your highness . the duke gave me four rouleaux of three hundred ducats each for present need , and bade me take them as his answer to your highness 's letter " .
0	kill on , wizard , kill if you can .
0	then do it in a german bun ! any way but that . will you walk , please ?
0	no wonder ! i had it all the time . thank you ever so much . as burnamy passed her , she let him see that she had both her gloves , and her heart yearned upon him for his instant smile of intelligence : some men would have blundered out that she had the lost glove in her hand . he came back directly , saying , " no , he did not find it " .
0	ah , well , no ; it is a good , solid little head in other directions , too . and it is no mean musician that the child has become . yes ; there are many well-known artists to whom i would listen less willingly than to my karen . it is only in the direction of _la toilette_ , only in the direction of _la toilette_ that the taste is rather rudimentary as yet . i was very cross last night , _hein_ ?
0	all hands , there ! up with you all ! go forward and pay out on the chain !
0	it is not meant as a compliment , my dear . i just will not have you going about in the dark . such people about too ! it 's dangerous . " but i always do go about alone . considering i have walked over the apennines , it 's common sense . you will make me so angry . i do not the least take it as a compliment " .
0	and tip us over ? destournier laughed . " suppose you try " ?
0	a story ! what has a story got to do with this ? " just a minute , " interposed jimmie dale gravely . " i want you to listen to a little story first " .
0	hey , philip , a glass ! " come , that 's enough , " svidriga lov stopped her at raskolnikov 's entrance . the girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully . she had sung her guttural rhymes , too , with a serious and respectful expression in her face .
0	let 's go over and see them anyway . if we can not find the melons , we can have a good time today at least . " bigger -- that is , most of them are . mrs . grinnell is going to take two in to the fair , but there are twenty-one big ones besides . i mean twenty . this is the twenty-oneth " .
0	then give them the gaff , lieutenant , " no , sir , " he replied .
0	oh , not _naturally_ ! it must be very unnatural for you to wait for anything . and you must be starving . so am i -- do you think there are enough cakes left for the two of us ?
0	do not introduce me to her , i see enough crazy people in the law courts .
0	but the trappists must have notice , it is a simple formality , for with a word from me , you will be received at once , but wait at least until i have sent this word ; i will post it this evening , so have no anxiety , and sleep in peace . then , at that moment , durtal had a strange experience , as often at st . severin , a sort of caressing touch and gentle push ; he felt a will insinuate itself into his own , and he drew back disquieted at seeing he had a double self , to find he was no longer alone in the depth of his being ; then he was inexplicably reassured , and gave himself up , and as soon as he had said " yes " he felt immensely relieved ; then passing from one extreme to the other , he was troubled at the idea that his departure could not take place at once , and was sorry that he had still to pass five days in paris .
0	it 's got around my leg , " get up , you ' re blocking the traffic , " i said .
0	uncle semyon 's on fire , the light of the moon was dimmed , and the whole village was by now bathed in a red quivering glow : black shadows moved over the ground , there was a smell of burning , and those who ran up from below were all gasping and could not speak for trembling ; they jostled against each other , fell down , and they could hardly see in the unaccustomed light , and did not recognize each other . it was terrible . what seemed particularly dreadful was that doves were flying over the fire in the smoke ; and in the tavern , where they did not yet know of the fire , they were still singing and playing the concertina as though there were nothing the matter .
0	he will never die , mr . noakes . he 's more alive now than ever . ' the rose and the ring end_sentence_quote why not ' the rose _in_ the ring ' ? " and a rose she is , my heartie , " said joey . " when i was a lad at ' ome , there was a chap named thackeray writing wonderful clever tales . i remembers one of them particular . it was called ' the rose and the ring end_sentence_quote i never see christine in them togs without thinking of the name of that book -- the rose and the ring , d ' ye get my idea ? mr . thackeray was a well-known writer when i was a boy . that was thirty year ago . i daresay he 's dead and forgotten now " .
0	no ! i should think not .
0	and give hell to ingolby , " what have you got to say about it ? i have been coming and going here for ten years . i belong -- bagosh , what do you want to ask ? hurry up . we have got work to do . we ' re going to raise hell in lebanon " .
0	martin venables , run to the house , and ask the doctor to come here at once . howard and aleck hurry down to the boat-house , and inquire about morton . send the boatman up at once with boats and men . mcdonald and marsden , go up to the meadow-dell and search . look sharp , all of you !
0	marry him ! " how could i do that " ? she asked , without looking up .
0	a badger ! we will have to trap him . i can not have him tearing my ranch up like this . these holes are the finest things in the world to break a critter 's leg in .
0	planet wisconsin ! woo-hoo ! " ok , so , you ' re trying to create your own world " .
0	what a romantic child you are , leslie ! when you are as old as i am , you will find you will not be thinking of interesting possibilities in a perfectly ordinary shut-up summer bungalow . it 's a pretty enough name , of course , but i must confess it does not suggest a single thing to me except that i ' m cold and want to get back to the fire . come along , dearie !
0	hey ! catch this , " hey ! help him ! get a rope , somebody " ! the man in uniform was shouting . he came rushing to the edge to find baartock 's father standing , quite calmly , waist deep in the rushing water , examining where the supports had been .
0	i have had some doubts , don john , but i am entirely satisfied now .
0	do you mean to insult me ? are you an idiot ?
0	one would take him for more . but of course his ways of thinking show how young he is . it will be interesting to see him in another five years .
0	get a gag rigged , we will find a way into his grog shop .
0	yes ; and the cause of no end of heartburnings and envies , from just after the holidays to some time in april every fellow will be busy trying to make the school team , and will feel aggrieved if he hits only the second team .
0	why not ? you can talk .
0	father , i hear something falling past ! hugging the bean pole for dear life , the scarecrow slid rapidly downward , everything was dark , but at times a confused roaring sounded in his ears .
0	i do not care what his business is worth , i would say what i please to that highwayman !
0	i see him again ! " i reckon that 's about the end of the lad , " answered nance in a low tone . " there 's nothing we can do but to wait " .
0	i never knew before , that my name was dan-yell !
0	good for the captain ! " peter " ! cried ludwig joyfully .
0	let 's drop down and crawl to safety ! " it 's a running fight , and coming right our way " ! gasped bert .
0	captain westfield ! throwing the reins over the pony 's head , the rider leaped from the saddle and with a rush had the elderly man clasped in his arms in an affectionate hug .
0	one at a time ! you take my breath away , yes , she is pretty -- i think you will say so . her hair ? i ' m sure i do not know what kind of hair she has . now you may begin again , my dear .
0	do not you hear the guns ? they ' re fighting -- not five miles from shore . something gleamed in the shadow of the nearer bungalow , and a man 's voice answered from within . what he said i did not catch , but suddenly i heard nettie calling very distinctly , " we have been bathing " .
0	you liar ! out of my house , you swindler ! you damned cheat !
0	you can not get across the streams , konstantin dmitrievitch , " so they ' re sowing clover behind the birch dale ? i will go and have a look at them , " he said , getting on to the little bay cob , kolpik , who was led up by the coachman .
0	it may be the governor has no bloodhounds , and would not permit their being brought into the island , but my master is bringing them in himself -- a lot with their drivers from cuba , and you maroons will have all you can do to hide . sure , d ' ye think every wan in the island is as foolish as the governor ? if you do , y ' are mistaken , and that 's all there is to say . the man 's face wrinkled like a rag , for there is one thing the native fears more than all else , and that is the tooth of the hound . but he gathered courage , and said : " the governor has no hounds . there ai not none in jamaica . we know dat -- all of us know dat -- all of us know dat , massa " .
0	what 's the matter , trying to get out of paying him ? you took _my_ money easy enough when i lost -- it works both ways !
0	i understand , boys , but never mind that -- akram told me all about it when we began to get anxious . we thought you had gone right on the trail of the elephant , which only led us out here , so we kept on as fast as we could . and this is the great rogue elephant ! how on earth did you boys kill him ? is amir dead ?
0	throw out the two fowling-pieces ! the talabas flew toward it , and at length were not more than two hundred paces away .
0	romanticize ! if you could see him , dad ! romance and my poor little beetle man do not live in the same world .
0	coffee , the meal proceeded in silence except for jeers and taunts of the " king " . for nobody cared to venture conversation which might prove a match to a powder magazine . whatever thoughts might be each man kept them to himself .
0	a fair hit ! i spoke without thought , but it will not touch the question of neutrality if you tell me how much longer we are likely to remain fast in the mud .
0	get the brushwood for yourself ! i ' m not your servant . i do know , that you will not hit me , you do not dare ; i do know , that you constantly want to punish me and put me down with your religious devotion and your indulgence . you want me to become like you , just as devout , just as soft , just as wise ! but i , listen up , just to make you suffer , i rather want to become a highway-robber and murderer , and go to hell , than to become like you ! i hate you , you ' re not my father , and if you have ten times been my mother 's fornicator !
0	how strange that seems ! i suppose i shall get used to it . but in town we seem never to have a whole day for a day 's work ; we always have to do part of it at night , or the next morning . do you ever have a day here that 's too large a size for its work ? " oh , we have the whole day for our work , " she answered , tolerantly .
0	stop right there ! did not i say i ' d jump you if you ever gave another peep about those blessed things . use the wings nature gave you the right way , and you will swim like a goose . why , you just _couldn ' t_ go under . you ' d be like an empty bottle with a cork in the neck , floating around .
0	is not the conversation assuming a rather dangerous direction ? " i heard something about it at the time , " said mrs . armitage . " you were very much in love with somebody else , were you not " ?
0	good gracious ! but how on earth did you hear all this ? it 's positively alarming .
0	i will put you out myself ! " more than that , " broke in madame dupont , " you are destroying that poor little baby ! you are a wicked woman " !
0	what ? " well , if you must got to know , " kapfer said , " he 's a feller by the name julius flixman " .
0	you do not think it 's honest ! o dear me , that ever i should have heard such an expression on your lips !
0	you do not have to ! " i would not do it again for a hundred pounds " ! he said hoarsely .
0	you will not kill the truth with your fist ! and you have no right to beat me , you dog !
0	and you are making all this fuss about a little thing like that , " no , siree ! she 's not that kind . maybe she gave me a look , but say ! -- she glided along as if -- well , just as if she knew she had a right to " .
0	the biped ! the measel in the corn-bin !
0	after all that stretch o ' talk , you ought to show me a whole case full of chisels .
0	yes , yes ! i do not want to be burnt up ! " oh , let us get out " ! came from one of the other girls .
0	elsbeth . " you are , you know , and that 's good enough for me , but i do not even know your name " .
0	send a boat , i must come aboard . quick !
0	come on , turn him back . if he gets past the stones , the water is deeper , and we shall lose him .
0	you are quite incorrigible , harry ; but i do not mind . it is impossible to be angry with you . when you see sibyl vane , you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a beast , a beast without a heart . i cannot understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves . i love sibyl vane . i want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine . what is marriage ? an irrevocable vow . you mock at it for that . ah ! do not mock . it is an irrevocable vow that i want to take . her trust makes me faithful , her belief makes me good . when i am with her , i regret all that you have taught me . i become different from what you have known me to be . i am changed , and the mere touch of sibyl vane 's hand makes me forget you and all your wrong , fascinating , poisonous , delightful theories . lord henry looked across the table . " dorian is never annoyed with me , " he answered . " i asked the question for the best reason possible , for the only reason , indeed , that excuses one for asking any question -- simple curiosity . i have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us , and not we who propose to the women . except , of course , in middle-class life . but then the middle classes are not modern " .
0	i ' m not drawing hazard pay . then he remembered , and whirled . he had left his back exposed to nogol .
0	that 's the way we want everybody to feel , clintonia is a neighborly town , and we always do our best to make visitors feel at home .
0	before thee none have come to that , to call me to holm , despite of all the ruin that many a man has had to take at my hands . well , i am ready to go . " now i will make an offer good in law , " says gunnlaug ; " that thou either pay me my money , or else that thou go on holm with me in three nights ' space " .
0	you need not talk ! we will fight the oz people ! we will smash ' em ; we will trample ' em ; we will gore ' em ; we will --
0	why do not you go to the rajah ? why do you go back to those dyaks in the great forest ? they should be killed . you cannot kill them , you cannot ; but our rajah 's men are brave ! you tell the rajah where the old white man 's treasure is . our rajah is good ! he is our very grandfather , datu besar ! he will kill those wretched dyaks , and you shall have half the treasure . oh , kaspar , tell where the treasure is ! tell me ! tell me out of the old man 's surat where you read so often at night .
0	not like this , such a roundabout way is not necessary . i have got a board here , which we can , without much trouble , use to build a bridge . after all , we could reach out for each other 's hands across the canal ; why should not our feet do the same ? or do you get dizzy ?
0	you might have done me the service of not excusing yourself to the squire when he came here , in such a way as to implicate me . " oh , fifty -- that is , just now . more like a thousand when i get to town . and where it 's to come from ! but never mind . ' pon my soul , i pity the fox i run down here . i feel i ' m exactly in his case in london . however , if i can do you any service , ned -- "
0	yes , that 's the way ! did you sleep well then ?
0	yes , and the funk you were in for fear spiny tatlow ' ud see us , and peach to the rest ! this related to their earliest meeting , and was a standing joke between them . mahony could recall the incident as clearly as though it had happened yesterday : how the sturdy little apple-cheeked english boy , with the comical english accent , had suddenly bobbed up at his side on the way home from school , and in that laughable sing-song of his , without modulation or emphasis , had offered to " swop " him , as above .
0	his daddy 's dead , and he 's no one to look after him ! " what 's the matter with the young squeaker there , mate " ? he asked in a bantering tone , thinking probably that i had broken a toy , or lost a lump of gingerbread from my pocket .
0	sure ! we ' re partners now , and i ' m ' jim ' to my friends , lou .
0	description terse , but correct . " a tragedy of some sort -- piracy and murder most likely . one of the natives named rahili who went out to the vessel , was an ex-sailor , who spoke and could also read and write english well , and he noticed that although the schooner was much weather-worn as if she had been a long while at sea , there was a newly-painted name on her stern -- _meta_ . that in itself was suspicious . i sent an account of the affair to the colonial papers , but nothing was known of any vessel named the _meta_ . since then the child had lived first with one family , and then another . as i have said , she is extremely intelligent , but has a curiously independent spirit -- ' refractory ' my wife calls it -- and does not associate with the other native girls . one day , not long ago , she got into serious trouble through her temper getting the better of her . lisa , my native assistant 's daughter is , as i daresay you know , a very conceited , domineering young lady , and puts on very grand airs -- all these native teachers and their wives and daughters are alike with regard to the ' side ' they put on -- and my wife has made so much of her that the girl has become a perfect female prig . well , it seems that paut e refused to attend my wife 's sewing class ( which lisa bosses ) saying that she was going out on the reef to get crayfish . thereupon lisa called her a _laakau tafea_ ( a log of wood that had drifted on shore ) and paut e , resenting the insult and the jeers and laughter of the other children , seized mademoiselle lisa by the hair , tore her blouse off her and called her ' a fat-faced , pig-eyed monster ' " .
0	you ' re so kind , " i should not wonder , " said charlie , " though calvary cemetery is about as near 's i will ever get to the country . say , you can set here on this soap box and let your feet hang down . the last janitor 's wife used to hang her washin ' up here , i guess . i will leave this door open , see " ?
0	i am afraid that everybody does not include me , but go on with your story ; how did you find that he lived in great bradley ?
0	oh , i will not have time to get in mischief , it will take all day to write my log book up to date . i have not touched it since night before last .
0	it 's only her way of saying that my mind is unhinged and that i ought to be sent to a private hospital for two . " what is the dislocation " ? asked mona , with a subtle , inquiring look but a manner which conveyed interest .
0	ha , ha , ha ! it is very well and shrewdly said , bambina mia . but between the two times of interference , my bianca , there is a happy medium ; an intervening space , a high table-land , we may say , after the dominion of fathers and uncles has been escaped from , and before that of sons and nephews begins -- a short time , during which a man may and can please himself . now , it seems to me , that your marchese -- pardon me for the anticipation , it is a mere figure of speech , your marchese di castelmare , i say , seems to me to be just in that happy position !
0	captain leclere ! " captain leclere , of the french service , " replied the captain .
0	new shoes ! new shoes ! oh , father , did you get a new jug and were they in it ?
0	chaste , but not gaudy , " very well . i will wear a white linen dress , with a black belt , and my black hat , " announced the girl .
0	by-by , dearie , you and i will get out of this shortly . do not grieve . i will be back in two or three weeks , or i will send for you . i ' d take you now , only i do not know how that country is out there . we will fix on some place , and then you watch me settle this fortune question . we will not live under a cloud always . i will get a divorce , and we will marry , and things will come right with a bang . money will do that .
0	crossley told me . good-by . " how did you know moldini was to teach me " ? exclaimed she .
0	aw , shut up ! let 's get going ; let 's get going . we gotta learn this poetry . damn ! i do not know anything about it . i did not crack the book till two days ago .
0	strictly speaking , it is not in the least , but unnecessary chaos is rather hateful , and , any way , i ' m not the only one who does not seem to like it . there 's the petty officer , and our friend , the sergeant , who was with roberts in afghanistan . " but is it your business to offer them that encouragement " ?
0	hurrah ! we have got the wampyre ! run a stake through his body , and then place him upon some dry wood , -- there 's plenty to be had about here , i am sure , -- and then burn him to a cinder .
0	the boat 's at the dock , steam all up . get on behind !
0	your honour , i can take no title , receive no honour . i have ended my life under the british flag . i go to live under the stars and stripes . when they had dismounted , lord mallow said : " i bring you the pay of the british government for something of what you have suffered , sir , and what will give your lady pleasure too , i hope . i come with a baronetcy given by the king . news of it came to me only this morning " .
0	we would love to stay , but i fear mammy will go home early .
0	and it 's we-e-e-et ! right down my neck !
0	ah , naughty , naughty ! i thought it was your voice in the crowd . your ladyship ' ud like to have me all nervous , would not you ? well -- if tom tripe was out of a job tomorrow , the very first person he ' d apply to for a new one would be the princess yasmini ; and she ' d give it him !
0	hang on , damn you ! bite in ! the eyes fluttered down , but daylight knew the message had been received . again he got the helpless man 's head and shoulders on the gunwale .
0	oh , yes , i will stand you on your head directly .
0	nothing of the sort , the hats you trimmed are nothing of any moment . any of my girls could have done as well .
0	the same , " jetson " ? exclaimed dave , rising .
0	get that old pumping engine ! we will have that blaze out in no time !
0	you are afraid i will not tell you ! why should i ? this great adventure of mine is progressing perfectly . a tremendous stake , haljan . a hundred million dollars in gold leaf . there will be fabulous riches for all of us -- " yes . but why ? where are we going " ?
0	these new titles come hard , do not they , pete ? " yes , miss -- ma ' am , i mean , " stammered the old man .
0	sir walter agreed to that , did he ? and yet he was willing to part with -- ah -- his sister .
0	it 's not surprising that things should be upside down when we ' re in the antipodes , " everything is so topsy turvy " ! exclaimed mabel , as she threaded the noisome streets , clinging close to joe 's arm . " i feel like alice in wonderland " .
0	give him a check drawn to his own order . he will have to endorse it when he deposits it , and that will make him responsible , " but suppose he wants an advance payment " ? queried hamlet .
0	let ' em alone ! they could not tell you how it was made , even if they could talk english ! give them a chance to learn how to talk ! they have had a bad time anyhow .
0	tell you what ? " why did not you tell us " ? yelled the other reproachfully .
0	come as fast as you can , stubbs , we have got to get out of sight .
0	you close your face , pinkie ! get down to cases ! do you think i got nothing else to do but chase you two around like a couple of puppy dogs that have not got sense enough to take care of themselves ? was not what i told you over the phone enough without me havin ' to come here ?
0	you will be hurt , if i have my way about it ! and hurt in a place where it always tells . i mean your pocketbook ! that 's the kind of a man i am -- practical .
0	how long will that take ? " propeller 's fouled , " he said to jeff . " we will have to send a man overboard to clear it " .

0	you do not know much about women . the worse you treat him the crazier she will be about him . and if she gets a knife , look out ! " i know what i ' m doing , " repeated imbrie stubbornly . " i ' m the master now . women turn naturally to the master . in a few days i will put this white man so low she will despise him " .
0	they have passed ! they have passed ! for the third time the trumpets blew , and from either end of that bridge , two hundred paces long , the knights flashed towards each other like living bolts of steel . the multitude rose to watch ; even sinan rose . only rosamund sat still , gripping the cushions with her hands . hollow rang the hoofs of the horses upon the stonework , swifter and swifter they flew , lower and lower bent the knights upon their saddles . now they were near , and now they met . the spears seemed to shiver , the horses to hustle together on the narrow way and overhang its edge , then on came the black horse towards the inner city , and on sped smoke towards the further gulf .
0	people are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves . it is what i call the depth of generosity . " dear basil ! i have not laid eyes on him for a week . it is rather horrid of me , as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame , specially designed by himself , and , though i am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than i am , i must admit that i delight in it . perhaps you had better write to him . i do not want to see him alone . he says things that annoy me . he gives me good advice " .
0	say , fellows , whom do you suppose this letter is from ? bet you a million you can not guess right in three guesses .
0	well , we have dodged through them before , sir , we can do it again .
0	i made you . " i have . i sat quite still " .
0	they will do _for_ it , if they all try to get in at once , the place will be simply crawling with daughters . how lucky we have done our sightseeing to-day !
0	auntie ! tell my lad to hurry up and to harness the horses !
0	perhaps you ' d better keep it there for a few minutes , then , until we are sure that we really want to go . as a matter of fact , i think it is rather nice right here in woodbridge , " libya ! well , i suppose we might as well go there as anywhere . you realize , of course , that we will not go until i put my foot on the carpet " -- his left foot was straggling over the edge .
0	hardly as bad as that , i guess , still , these fordham boys do look more like a college eleven than a high school crowd .
0	a useful bauble , but its purpose is served .
0	who comes there ? " maybe he is one of the blacks , " i observed . but on mounting the platform placed inside the stockade , i saw that the man was a white in hunter 's garb , and that he was carrying a deer on his shoulders . he was accompanied by a handsome hound , which every now and then turned round , as if on the watch to give him timely notice of the approach of any one who might be following him . he hurried on , notwithstanding the weight of the animal and holding his rifle in his hand , looking back every now and then as if he did not feel himself secure from pursuit .
0	each to his taste , you know , i suppose we will be able to get you to take us out in the launch sometimes while we ' re here ?
0	susan ! she saw the figure of her daughter pass before the faint and livid clearness of a window . then it appeared in the doorway for a second , and the door swung to with a clang . madame levaille , as if awakened by the noise from a long nightmare , rushed out .
0	robinson , you ' re a -- a -- a fool ! i am in perfect health , damn you , sir .
0	i know that i can trust you . i have seen that you have a loyal heart ; but this promise sha not cost you anything . i shall answer no questions . now , i shall have to send a message to se ora valencia . i could have promised him more than my word in that moment .
0	it 's the next train she 's going by , old moses-not-much , " ' if at first you do not succeed , try , try again , ' mr . mazarine " ! called someone from the crowd .
0	all well ! and just going to have our christmas dinner .
0	it is not that , it is the spoiling of my combination , on which i have wasted sleepless nights . a curse on my mad folly . do you know who the banker was ?
0	so do i , and if i get them i shall keep them , and if you have not anything more to say you can leave me . i ' m busy .
0	i am happy for you , " oh , i can not bear to have you look so frozen , sylvia " . edna suddenly took her friend 's hand . " i do apologize sincerely for yesterday , and i am going to tell you what no one else knows or will know for some time , owing to the strange circumstances . the mail last evening brought my father 's consent to my marrying the man i love . i will not tell you more about it yet , except that he is an englishman , and we had almost despaired of winning over my parents . what ? not a word , sylvia " ? for the blue eyes gazed , and the parted lips were stiffly mute . after a minute warmth began to flow back into the younger girl 's face . the hand edna held began to return its pressure .
0	it 's this way , gertie , that 's nora 's brother 's wife -- down where i have been working -- ai not very partial to the english . i guess my wife 's been rather fed up with her talk .
0	jan larose -- you say you can not move ? o ' grady began to move , guiding himself slowly along the wall . then , suddenly , he stopped .
0	carrie ! do not you never use a word like that again ! " does that prove her a prostitute " ? asked carol .
0	i intended also staying for two or three days , but my business will not wait .
0	this ? am i ' this ' ? you look at me as if i was ' this ' .
0	hurro ! this is th ' koind av a picnic pwhat oi admire ! come on , ye nagurs ! it 's barney mulloy ye ' re runnin ' up against , an ' begobs ! he 's good fer th ' whole crowd av yez !
0	fiery fiends ! another !
0	he will put me in jail , dick creel says he 's kind o ' doty .
0	and then you will want to hit the trail for home , though we do not get as severe storms as they do farther north , nor do they come so early . but it 's bad enough , sometimes .
0	that was the last explosion you heard , i was not leaving anything to chance . i am going to go and drink beer -- iced beer , in long glasses . _toujours toi_ .
0	i guess you will not except anybody when you have seen lester . well , make your mother let school go for once ! " except david " .
0	he means horse mackerel , give him the axe , tom . i do not like the looks of those fish , either . i will take a weapon myself .
0	dash it all , do not shoot ! almost at the same time , though the light was already turned off , there came a report : the doctor had fired .
0	woof ! woof ! _woof_ ! " sniff -- sniff -- _snort_ " ! the red setter sucked at the crack in the door .
0	you think so ? very good , very good ! you are very chivalrous ! you have a touch of the american in you , have you not ? -- there is a tendency in the men of the new world to be always on their knees before women . strange , very strange !
0	that 's an epigrammatic way of putting it , orde . " anywhere else they might be leaders , but they have no social weight here " .
0	i will if you want me to , but you will look awfully silly .
0	indeed i do not , what does a man care for motherhood -- when he has not a ghost of a chance at fatherhood ? and besides -- what 's the good of talking sentiment when we are just men together ? what a man wants of women is a good deal more than all this ' motherhood ' !
0	i do not see that it would , cyril , for you know as much more about handling a boat like this than i do , as the boatswain does than yourself . you have been on board her night and day for more than a month , and even if you knew nothing about her at all , prince rupert would have been right to choose you as a recognition of your great services last time . do not think anything about it . we are friends , and it does not matter a fig which is the nominal commander . i was delighted to come , not only to be with you , but because it will be a very great deal pleasanter being our own masters on board this pretty little yacht than being officers on board the _henrietta_ where we would have been only in the way except when we went into action .
0	well , well ! have it your own way , but the sight of your face in the patent outsides of the country press would be worth half a dozen subscribers in every school district throughout the length and breadth of this fair land . " i guess , " said the old man , " we will get along without the cut " .
0	hullo , jack , here you are at last ! come and join us , old fellow . we ' re playing at ` piling the sacks end_sentence_quote
0	do not you threaten me , or i will have the law on you ! " you will catch it , for treating us so meanly , " added ben .
0	yes , miss , " but if i order you to go -- "
0	i thought we were going all the way like that ! cicely was therefore a little surprised when at the next hill this flier was brought to a walk .
0	oh , go to the devil , all of you ! it 's known long ago that in your company there is no place for a respectable woman !
0	i met them on class day , and then i saw them -- the day after i left campobello . " how long have you known them " ?
0	i like the class , in which you place me ! i shall be one of the little pieces that you unpack at the hotels , or at the worst in the hired houses , like this wonderful one , and put out with the family photographs and the new magazines . but it 's something not to be so big that i have to be buried .
0	there 's one thing at any rate i can not ever wipe out , i have got to stick it . it may be amusing to see how it all pans out . i suppose the very last passion left us is curiosity .
0	i am afraid the high valley is a poor preparation for west cedar street , it _will_ seem a limited career to both of us at first . but cheer up , poppet ; i ' m going to put you into a dancing-class this winter , and very likely at christmas-time papa will treat us both to a moral drayma . there _are_ consolations , even in boston .
0	well , it is a great game , some of the movie stars have more laughable eccentricities or idiosyncracies than that . i wonder what our wonota will develop if she becomes a star ?
0	by g -- d , woman , you shall feel the length of my knife if you do not close your mouth , " you " ? she asked , contemptuously ; " why , if my old man was within sound of my voice , you would run like a sheep from a dog . you are the biggest coward connected with the gang , and they only keep you ' cos you can mend their clothes . a tailor ! bah , you are only the ninth part of a man , and a botch at that " .
0	ah , but do not be so over-logical , dear child . you ' re my goal ! " i do trust you , darling mama . i do see that you are warm-hearted , full of kind impulses . but i think that your life is confused , uncertain of any goal . if you are to be near me in the way you crave , you must change . and we _can_ , dear , with faith and effort . when you have found yourself , found a goal , i shall feel you near " .
0	tryin ' to get out , old boy ? them irons will need a crow-bar beside your tin , before you can open ' em .
0	but if i have business out there ? " no , " he said , " i have to think of it . the responsibility would be mine " . here the man broke through -- " oh , i talk like a prig " ! he cried . " but do not you see , i ' m not up here on my own . i can not do what i would like . a policeman has got to be proper , has not he " ?
0	what ! mount , sir . i order you .
0	try her again , i tell you , are you going to stand chinning there while a hundred thousand dollars slips through our fingers ?
0	get your kids out of here , john ! judith 's in there with the door locked !
0	tell them it went overside , tell them to try it again . ortiz is in hell ! to try again ! he 's dying !
0	hilloa , there ! but in this instance it was very dull business , for the reason that there were no shells to be found . they had all become weary of groping about in the sand , when johnny looked at the bay , and observed a boy coming towards them , rowing a boat .
0	you are getting old , gunnar . did anyone ever guarantee that ford to you for always ? gunnar 's first few words were unprintable . " there was a river close to my house where the water ran silver over the stones of the ford . and there gunnar used to bathe . this is slop , nors-king . nothing but slop " .
0	look out ! bascomb 's movement had been noted by the spectators , and a cry of astonishment and warning broke from many lips .
0	next verse , legs at attention . more action there ! la-da-da-dee ! one , two , three !
0	and that idea made you also hold your tongue , which is quite an unaccountable miracle in its way , have you never heard the pretty legend that attaches to such an occurrence as a sudden silence in the midst of high festivity ? an angel enters , bestowing his benediction as he passes through .
0	that does not matter ! it 's a disgusting smell ! turn them out !
0	all hands awake ! aha , mr . cameron ! good sleep , eh ? slept like a bear myself . now grub , and off ! still blowing , eh ? well , so much the better . there is a spot thirty miles on where we will be snug enough . how 's breakfast , little thunder ? this is our only chance to-day , so do not spare the grub .
0	ah , but i can not wear mine , " they tell me you have some better in paris , in the same situation " .
0	i will try , hugh , to be more reserved , more like the wife of an important man . the sardells were the new yorkers who sat next us .
0	you know ! you know ! " but how have you been supported all these years ? what have you done " ?
0	tatsu , wait ! surely you cannot mean to return when you have but now arrived ! be seated . i insist ! there is much to talk about .
0	get over a life-boat on each side and attend to those idiots ! a quartermaster was at the captain 's heels .
0	for god 's sake , do not say that ! i forbid you to think of it . you cannot do this after all i have done to save you . ach , you are jesting ; i should have known .
0	if my folk are mad , i am not , i will go with you and on the instant .
0	well -- he 's run away , for one thing . the bank examiners found the deficit . bailey , the cashier , went out on an errand -- and did not come back . the method was simple enough -- worthless bonds substituted for good ones -- with a good bond on the top and bottom of each package , so the packages would pass a casual inspection . probably been going on for some time . " how do you know the cashier did it " ? she said in a low voice .
0	that 's not the point , and of course i do not mean to say that -- outwardly -- he 's not . his manner and appearance are distinguished . it 's the soul that 's vulgar .
0	i have seen them myself , they are very conspicuous . and i would warn you , sir , that if you palter with the truth in such little matters you may darken your more important statements with suspicion . why did you strike mr . watson ?
0	what , sir ! compare me to a raven ?
0	well , we will visit you regular , " to hell with your papers . i ' m here and i ' m goin ' to stay " .
0	debbie , debbie , will you take me ? will you have me ?
0	you are so funny when you puff yourself up that way and try to look so kingly . pray how is this _our_ afternoon ? what is left of it belongs to pablo . i am going to find him something to eat and then i mean to talk to him every minute until father comes . you may stay if you like , but we shall talk in spanish . " are you going to let that greaser spoil our afternoon " ? he asked in a tone of offended majesty .
0	oh , uncle dear ! what are you planning to do ?
0	i suppose it is -- or at least , in a certain sense , i ' m responsible for it . but i am lucky enough to have a wrecking-boss -- two of them , in fact , and both good ones . " is that part of your work -- to get the trains on the track when they run off " ?
0	' tis going to part us , laugh , laugh , beloved , so that we may not hear !
0	thanks , i can do that little job by myself .
0	you said that was the indian on the trail -- my never being quite sure of you ! will you take an oath with me ? " i know it ! when you are not quite sure of me , you love me best " !
0	in that case we could not have gotten hold of the money , remember , " it 's the most exciting thing i ever heard of , " sighed wallace drawing a full breath , " and i was not in it ! it 's the sort of thing i long for . if i ' d only waited another two weeks before coming down " !
0	i ' m not going to kill any of them , besides , that is not the way i look at it . this fellow megales is a despot . he has made out to steal the liberty of the people from them . president diaz can not interfere because the old rascal governor does everything with that smooth , oily way of his under cover of law . it 's up to some of the people to put up a good strong kick for themselves . i ai not a bit sorry to give them the loan of my foot while they are doing it .
0	well , you are pleased ; that is the principal thing . i have saved two hundred pounds , and that is something . it will go towards furnishing . rosa was delighted , and as soon as dinner was over , and the waiters gone , she came and kissed christopher .
0	take him away ! take him away ! he is dead ! i killed him ! do not let him touch me !
0	father ! father , wake up ! the bear ! the bear has come ! father ! tanana !
0	he 's in his flurry , lads -- he 's in his flurry ! he will be dead in another minute .
0	that 's so -- you said it was business , but i must say you are early birds , " yes , sir , i know that , " said dave , " and that is why i came to see you " .
0	cuckoo ! " you bally ass " ! fred murmured .
0	i know that , ef it had not been for foolishness he ' d hev it now .
0	come on , peggy , do not be a ' fraid-cat ! the flames were lower now , and with a sudden running leap isabelle jumped over them . without hesitation the whole line followed -- all except peggy , who held back .
0	a week ! here 's my stomach already leaping like a fish at the smell of this hole . you brute bear ! it 's a smell of bones . it turns my inside with a spoon . may the devil seize you when you ' re sleeping ! you sha not go : i will tell you everything -- everything . i can not tell you anything more than i have told you . she gave me a cigarette -- there ! now you know : -- gave me a cigarette ; a cigarette . i smoked it -- there ! your faithful servant !
0	what in thunder are you trying to do ? are you going to sink us ?
0	to that amount only ? pooh ! her death will buy more than that . as no one single office will insure for more than 5,000 pounds , and as it was easy to persuade her that such offices were liable to failure , and that it was usual to insure in several , and for a larger amount than the sum desired , i got her to enter herself at three of the principal offices . the amount paid to us on her death will be 15,000 pounds . it will be paid ( and here i have followed the best legal advice ) in trust to me for your benefit . hence , therefore , even if our researches fail us , if no son of yours can be found , with sufficient evidence to prove , against the keen interests and bought advocates of heirs-at-law , the right to laughton , this girl will repay us well , will replace what i have taken , at the risk of my neck , perhaps , -- certainly at the risk of the hulks , -- from the capital of my uncle 's legacy , will refund what we have spent on the inquiry ; and the residue will secure to you an independence sufficing for your wants almost for life , and to me what will purchase with economy , a year or so of a gentleman 's idle pleasures . are you satisfied thus far ?
0	fire-spouters ! an impartial observer would not have found it easy to determine which party expressed more surprise .
0	i ' m simply ashamed of you , the way you act , like you never would grow up and get a little common sense , what with scaring me into conniption fits , and as i was just going to say , and i only say it for your own good , if you have not got enough sense to know how little sense you have got , you at your time of life , why , well , all i can say is -- you ought to know better . father rounded the table , stealthily and treacherously put his lips at her ear , and blew a tremendous " zzzzzzzz , " which buzzed in her ear like a file on a saw-blade .
0	this is a new experience for me , but not one that i dislike . in fact , i will be glad to offer my services in the same capacity , at any time , for you girls .
0	but what are you living here for , lindau ? " i will ask you , " said lindau , quietly , " and i thank you for that . but i can wait ; i to not needt any money just at bresent " . as if he saw some appeal for greater frankness in , march 's eye , he went on : " i tid not gome here begause i was too boor to lif anywhere else , and i to not stay in pedt begause i could not haf a fire to geep warm if i wanted it . i ' m nodt zo padt off as marmontel when he went to paris . i ' m a lidtle loaxurious , that is all . if i stay in pedt it 's zo i can fling money away on somethings else . heigh " ?
0	considerin ' several , be you , cephas ? well , all i hope is , that the one you favor most -- the girl you have asked once a ' ready -- is considerin ' you !
0	i ' m hungry , the wieroo raised his wings in a very human shrug and waved his bony claws toward the human skulls supporting the ceiling . his gesture was eloquent ; but he embellished it by remarking , " and possibly if you are " .
0	yes , and hurry back , hans ! we will race on the canal tonight , if the mother lets us .
0	yes , sir , that 's what she is . keepin ' folks awake howlin ' !
0	we will listen to nothing , until the poor devil is free , and then we will talk until daylight , if it will please the police .
0	ay , lady ; i ken well what the men say . how that poor youth is spell-bound , and that you are casting your glamour over him as of old over my poor old lady and little master bernard . " whist , thora ! or you must take a buffet , " said grisell , clenching a fist unused to striking , and trying to regard chastisement as a duty . " you know full well that my only speech with master hardcastle is as his hostess " .
0	damn your early hours ! what are you doing here ? i suppose you have been showing that dead face of yours about the neighborhood -- why did not you stay at belle plain since you could not keep away ?
0	pouf . " now you know . how did you get here , what do you want , what have they done to you " ?
0	burnt ! " a letter from countess anna to countess d ' isorella , " said the duchess .
0	hurrah ! " we win , we win " ! exclaimed toad , throwing his hat into the air . " three cheers for captain reddy " !
0	they sure do fool you ! and now , before we get led astray by any more , let 's get settled for the night . it looks as if we ' d have to stay here .
0	hey ! halloo ! ahoy there ! you , em ' lous , what is it ?
0	it 's a dead bluff . light out of this field before i put you off . " then that will be five shillings . i will say nothing about the snares ; wire 's cheap " .
0	my life ! would you care , madam , if i were dead ? would you shed any tears ? not you ! why should you ? at this late hour of time , when after twenty-one years passed in each other 's close company we are no nearer to each other in heart and soul than if the sea murmuring yonder at the foot of these walls were stretching its whole width between us ! besides -- we are both past our youth ! and , according to certain highly instructed scientists and philosophers , the senses and affections grow numb with age . i do not believe this theory myself -- for the jejune love of youth is as a taper 's flame to the great and passionate tenderness of maturity , when the soul , and not the body , claims its due ; when love is not dragged down to the vulgar level of mere cohabitation , after the fashion of the animals in a farmyard , but rises to the best height of human sympathy and intelligent comprehension . who knows ! -- i may experience such a love as that yet , -- and so may you !
0	i will take those , he disappeared and came back with a tray covered with the most beautiful diamonds that had ever left the cutter 's hands . the colonel went over them slowly , examining them and putting a selected number aside .
0	yes , one of them , from my post of observation behind the kitchen door , and he did appear so ridiculous with his gold eye-glasses , looking as solemn as an owl , and glancing around with that expression of supercilious curiosity , as though he expected to find us all wild indians , or something of the sort .
0	disperse ! to your homes ! the duke is dead !
0	i will try to oblige you , boys , what you thinkin ' to do : hit that can or plant a lead mine ?
0	but is she dying ? " man can work against the skill of man , " significantly replied doctor crandall , " but not against the will of heaven " .
0	i guess we can earn a dollar a day at this rate , " you are fine pickers , " she told the boys , seeing how quickly they worked . " i pay ten cents a basket , you know " .
0	more than good , christianlike . are not we told in the new testament to forgive our enemies ?
0	halt ! no good : impossible . we must ride round , dismount , and join royland through the breach . forward !
0	madam , since you put it so , i care not who comes . the lord protector himself shall not drag you from me .
0	matter ? read this ! " why , what 's up " ? said the latter , who seemed none the worse for his big climb . " what 's the matter " ?
0	this was our first meal together -- on our honeymoon ! joan looked at him and felt her nerves begin to tingle . a soft , warm wave stole over her .
0	my precious , " bring strickland here , dirk . i will do my best for him " .
0	thou art rude , sirrah , but i blame thee not . be patient , master page . i will come to thee when thy locks have been woven into a wig and thou shalt see how well they become me .
0	you ' re all crazy , you do not know a riddle when you see one . do you call those riddles ? a riddle is something where you ask a question and the answer , kind of , means something else .
0	now you have done it ! now you have done it ! did not i tell you ? oh , this will be a hell of a picnic !
0	keep back , damn it , another step and i will fire !
0	oh , what shall i do ! my husband will never forgive me if this becomes known .
0	he did ! well , then , i must say --
0	not a penny . and mr . hammond sent me a nice check on account of royalties , too , " ai not lost any of that money , have ye " ? persisted the miller .
0	i wish to god i were ! " do not stand there as if you were made of stone " !
0	oh , i was just wondering .
0	look , father , he has come back .
0	yes , i guess you have , i played with tottenville last year . i ' m captain this season . jarvis is my name .
0	i can not imagine you a husband , " that would be one of the requirements , " said charlton . " i have sense enough to know that , no matter how much i liked a woman before marriage , it could not last long if she were incompetent . she ' d irritate me every moment in the day . i ' d lie awake of nights despising her . and how she would hate me " !
0	no more do i . i have seen so much of faking -- in women as well as in men -- that it 's hard for me to believe anyone is genuine . she glanced inquiringly at him . " i do not understand , " she said .
0	you will have a chance to dig , we could not begin to bring all of it ; we merely took the jewels and the deeds and what money our clothes would hold . the rest --
0	why , my dear , it was nothing but a harmless new york flat -- seven rooms and a bath . " no . that was the most frightful thing about it ; it had no mouth " .
0	no ! anthony made a long arm over the projection of his coat , and clasped it securely ; sullenly refusing to answer . " dear uncle ; hear me out . i come to you , because i know you are rich . i was on my way to your lodgings when we met ; we were thrown together . you have more money than you know what to do with . i am a beggar to you for money . i have never asked before ; i never shall ask again . now i pray for your help . my life , and the life dearer to me than any other , depend on you . will you help me , uncle anthony ? yes " !
0	ruth , ruth , do you mean to say you have not heard a word of all my glowing compliments on your rowing ?
0	it will be all right , me lads ! herring will be here on the next train , with a bunch o ' men , an ' i will git your dad , gus , too . must have this building up just like it was in ten days . an ' now count up just what you lads have lost ; the hull sum total , b ' jinks ! i ' m goin ' to be the insurance comp ' ny in this deal .
0	then when the blinds are rolled to the middle sash in the daytime no one can see them , laddie picked up a blind . " see this plain back ? it 's double coated like a glaze . that is so the sun shining through glass will not fade it . the flowers would be gone in a week . they belong inside , mother , sure as you live " .
0	you can not do it , do not try it , joe , you will be all burnt up .
0	what does all this mean , mr . marcy ? and why did you throw him overboard ?
0	gabriel is right . when people are sick they love to hear of the greatest doctor of all . read about the ten lepers , paula . " tell her to read the story of jesus healing the sick people , " came the eager voice of gabriel .
0	here , give me another paper ! one with the prize fight account .
0	then let me make the less valuable purchase . " you shall have my past thoughts , if you please , " said i , trying to speak lightly . " i would rather not sell my present ones at the price " .
0	surely hiram bassett has not turned his cows out in this weather , the ground was hard and the ice was thick on the river ; but the early snows that had fallen were gone . it was the day after christmas , and helen and ruth had been at home from school at briarwood hall less than a week . tom , too , who attended the military academy at seven oaks , was home for the winter holidays . it was snapping cold weather , but the sun had been bright this day and for three hours or more the friends had enjoyed themselves on the ice .
0	and madame , has madame her luncheon ? " see , monsieur -- your luncheon " ! mumbled margot , carrying a tray into the workroom on his busiest days .
0	' rah ! ' rah ! ' rah ! harvard ! harvard ! collingwood does not allow himself to get excited in the least . he keeps his men steadily at work , husbanding their strength as far as possible .
0	they have made us out . she 's about to heave to , sir . hurrah ! hurrah ! lord reginald stood up and waved his hat , while all hands shouted at the top of their voices .
0	that 's why i sent for you . i need a man with imagination ! there 's a woman you have got to work with on this occasion who can imagine a shade or two too much . what 's worse , she 's ambitious . so i chose you to work with her . " that depends , sir . yes , i can imagine it " .
0	oh , i do not know what kind , a common or garden ox , to use the slang expression . it is the garden part of it that i object to . my garden has just been put straight for the winter , and an ox roaming about in it will not improve matters . besides , there are the chrysanthemums just coming into flower .
0	murder ! you are indeed . is that what you call pulling me out of it ? you have stuck me fast .
0	well , i suppose they know their business , i ' m sure no man would go into the church if he did not feel a call , and the fact of his doing so and taking up that life should be enough to prevent any right-minded person from ridiculing mere human frailties of voice and manner and appearance .
0	will i give them ? will i break the seal which guards the tablets of my youth , and let a stranger 's eyes read lines to which i have shut my own for these many years ! do you not know that for me to tell you what i once knew of edwin urquhart is to bare my own breast to view , and subject to new sufferings a heart that it has taken fifteen years of solitude to render callous ?
0	now , yez are to worruk for me , and i want ivery man here to understand what 's what . i kin lick anny man in the gang .
0	see that the fire 's banked , polly . looks as if i ' d laid on a powerful lot of wood without thinking . you ' re durned comical , polly . what you said about the lord putting yeast into folks and the world _is_ comical .
0	i do not see how pee-wee can get out of the troop , because strictly speaking , he has never been in the troop ; on the contrary the troop has been in him , as one might say .
0	i feel better than i did ! it 's a cinch now that we will get them both through you , and it s a cinch that the white moll will not cut in to-night . put those sparklers away with the rest until we get ready to ' fence ' them .
0	and you want me to get a twist on old blunt ? " i can not find out , " she said , with a laugh , dropping into the language of the street , " anything she is short in , or i would " .
0	pleased to meet you , spencer , where are your trunks ? left them behind , i suppose ? no ? well , that 's a surprise . tell that porter to look after them . if you have any trouble with him , mention it to me . _i ' ll_ make him jump around . where 's the automobile ? outside ? where ? take me to it .
0	is there anything worse ? i feel real cheap .
0	no . i am quite at liberty . come and sit down ! she was aware of his eyes looking at her very searchingly as he took it . " i hope you do not mind a visitor at this hour , " he said .
0	i can answer for all that they have not , " and you , ladies and gentlemen " ?
0	yes , " is that chief inspector kerry " ?
0	call the porter here ! " it 's extraordinary " ! navagin thought in perplexity , as he paced about the study . " it 's strange and incomprehensible ! it 's like sorcery " !
0	i will not be argued with ! now stand clear , for when i say ' three , ' down goes the wiper .
0	all right , take your reins . form your unloading circles on me . we will be here for a day or two .
0	yes , i can keep track of your show through the theatrical papers , joe . let me hear from you occasionally . write to the new york address where i buy most of my stuff . they will always have the name of my forwarding post-office on file . and now , my boy , i wish you all success . you have been a great help to me -- not to mention such a little thing as saving my life , " well , good-bye , " said joe , as the professor went with him to the railroad station , the burns having progressed rapidly in their healing . " you will always be able to write me in care of the circus " .
0	did your parents never punish you , then ? " that 's going to be hardest , i think , " bradford said . " i know who she is , and i still have trouble with the lifegiver as an inquisitor " .
0	you used to be a perfect little devil , soon the colonel was describing some of the great battles in which he had taken part , and romeo listened with an eager interest which was all the more flattering because it was so evidently sincere . in the library , meanwhile , allison was renewing his old acquaintance with juliet .
0	you ' re beastly impertinent , and i will report you to sir samuel .
0	i expect i will have to burn down the cottage when he has done with it ; his son is certainly not going to stop there afterwards . i do not know if a rich man is justified in loafing or not . we will leave that to the economists , but i have frankly no use for the fellow who wants to loaf at other folk 's expense . however , i will fix the powder and we will pull out . i do not like the job . " no , " said carrie , firmly . " shanks is white trash and lives like a hog . they would not have stood for him a month at our settlements . but how do you think he will use bank-end " ?
0	take the christian ! at length the merchant made a careless gesture , and walked away .
0	of course not , do not worry . we will support you , only you must agree to do all the talking .
0	he 's a wine merchant , " you were ever the dubious gentleman , sim , " laughed his grace . " and what -- if i may take the liberty -- seeks our excellent and impeccable gaul so far west " ?
0	julius , good dog , fetch them ! he was out of sight almost a yard away , but they heard him whine once as the wind dashed him against the cliff .
0	one did disappear a few weeks before you came , we will search the boxes this afternoon .
0	we will not cart any more ! we are tired to death ! let her go and cart it herself !
0	oh , my , no ! santa claus takes the toys to earth in his sleigh , drawn by reindeer .
0	trust bantry hagan , i took good care of that . i fooled the plain-clothes chap who was following me round , gave him the slip , and then came to see ye . lucky for us i had a pull with one of the bluecoats the night of the raid at worden 's . it would have been easy for me to get assistance in ducking that night ; but i would not go without ye , and you had the irons on . it looked bad .
0	well , hero , nodding and smiling , the president of the galactic federation and admiral stapleton left the dispensary room -- with the doctor .
0	the situation appeals to my sporting blood which i believe has been greatly underrated in crowheart . whatever i may chose to do in the future , please consider that i regard it solely in the light of recreation . it 's one 's enemies that give a zest to life , you know , and if i choose to match my wits against the wits of andy p . symes -- my wits and resources -- do not grudge me the pleasure , for it is in much the same spirit in which i might play the races or work out a game of chess .
0	what will you wager to-day ? so he set forth again , singing a merry tune . hardly had he seated himself upon the hillside when he heard the giant 's whistle . the prince was not at all frightened , although the giant scowled with anger because he had been obliged to give up his herd of cattle .
0	i feel very much like an explorer in darkest africa , shall i be coming across an unknown lake presently , or a race of pigmies ? hallo ! what 's that ? light at last .
0	hello ! why do not yuh come on in ? what yuh standing there chewing the rag for ?
0	if they will not bring any more than that , what are you going to do about it ? " i will not sell them for five cents apiece , stumpy , " replied leopold , very decidedly .
0	i am shot . by and by the lion and the wolf came to the wall . the wolf did not go over the wall but waited to see what would happen . the lion sprang over the wall . very soon he caught and killed a pony . then the archer let fly an arrow .
0	what does this mean ? what the -- ?
0	i am so afraid you will think me silly . i saw my opening and made use of it . " we men may be stupid both individually and collectively , " i said . " but i can answer for one man being sympathetic to anything you like to say to him " .
0	where are your car keys ? suddenly generating an idea , i whirled and ran back to farnsworth 's house . he was standing in the yard now , shivering from the morning air , looking at me like a little lost and badly scared child .
0	we are learning much these days , i am even learning to like my chocolate without milk or cream .
0	oh , you feminine person ! i told my dear old mother as a dead and solemn secret .
0	it is , we have only got one chinatown worthy of the name , in london , and that 's not ten minutes ' walk from here .
0	that 's all right , you must not escape , you know , dan ' l , for we depend on you for the music .
0	carried , _nem . con_ . , " well , you sing that and you will make the fellows die with laughing . and mind you illustrate it with plenty of life-like pantomime , do you hear " ?
0	what do you mean by that ? the commandant had risen . he bent towards fandor across his writing-table . fandor also had risen -- dumoulin 's air was threatening : he was furious .
0	it is partly that , partly for the pleasure of seeing you , of course . and partly -- you know already , since you know everything , that i am a friend of mr . dundas , the young englishman accused of a murder which he could not possibly have committed .
0	that 's considerably less odious . " we trusted her with something more valuable , my dear , " said i . " our guileless faith in human nature . anyhow we will keep the faith undamaged " .
0	fabien , is it thou ? speak , is it thou ?
0	no , no , not at all , listen .
0	ferocious creature ! " well , let everything go to the devil as quickly as possible . i ' m sure i should be pleased if the earth suddenly opened up or was burned or destroyed somehow . only i were left to the last in order to see the others consumed " .
0	you seem to find her attractive yourself , " yes , she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up , but you know she is not at all hideous . she has such a good-natured face and eyes . strikingly so . and the proof of it is that lots of people are attracted by her . she is such a soft , gentle creature , ready to put up with anything , always willing , willing to do anything . and her smile is really very sweet " .
0	you have not told me yet what happened next at the beggars ' feast , and how you found out who _she_ was . " some of them fly high nowadays , eh , mr . air-pirate " ?
0	no matter what you said , my boy , no fool could have figured that out as nicely as i did .
0	pretty . frame it and keep it to comfort you when you feel lonely , " she was certainly dead when my men took her picture . the print shows the death grimace clearly " .
0	keep close , my men , down upon your faces .
0	look ! look ! a carriage , and three ladies in it !
0	a sea monster ? i have fought with worse than him : i would have faced immortals for your sake : how much more a beast of the sea ? " i am the daughter of cepheus , king of iopa , and my mother is cassiopoeia of the beautiful tresses , and they called me andromeda , as long as life was mine . and i stand bound here , hapless that i am , for the sea monster 's food , to atone for my mother 's sin . for she boasted of me once that i was fairer than the queen of the fishes ; so she in her wrath sent the sea floods , and her brother the fire king sent the earthquakes , and wasted all the land , and after the floods a monster bred of the slime what devours all living things . and now he must devour me , guiltless though i am -- me who never harmed a living thing , nor saw a fish upon the shore but i gave it life , and threw it back into the sea ; for in our land we eat no fish , for fear of their queen . yet the priests say that nothing but my blood can atone for a sin which i never committed " .
0	hope ? what d ' you mean ? " peace , friends " ! he cried . " i give you peace ! strike me not down with those terrible weapons of yours ! for verily i bring you hope again " !
0	do not you want any ? he watched her in silence as she poured out the tea , and the thought crossed his mind that it was incredibly long since he had seen a woman preside over a meal . the deftness of her fingers filled him with an unfamiliar , half-inquisitive wonder . so interesting was the sensation that , when she held his cup towards him , he did not immediately see it .
0	nay , nay ! " hold here , little people " ! she cried , " let me drop some cordial into the pitcher " .
0	i ' m not so sure . she was ready to throw me out of the kitchen to-night . she is really a virago . do you know what one of the men said about her ? jane 's plumb movin ' to me . she 's about halfway between ' you go to hell ' and ' you take me in your arms to rest end_sentence_quote
0	the shells are as hollow as i feel , " hold on , " i said . " we do have something tangible , for if they disappeared they left their shells behind them " . and i pointed to some cartridge-shells that lay on the ground beside the mail-car . " my theory of aerial bullets will not do " .
0	am i not sadder than you , my sister ? expecting joy is a happy pain . the future 's fathomless mine of treasures , all countless hordes of possible pleasures , might bring their store to my feet in vain . sighed princess may , " will it last much longer , time throbs so slow and my heart so quick ; and oh , how long is the day in dying ; weary am i of waiting and sighing , for hope deferred makes the spirit sick " .
0	yes , beth . i did know one prince rather intimately -- rather too intimately . she paused a moment , looking into the fire . and then , " were you ever acquainted with any princes in europe , mr . nichols " ?
0	oh , do let me cry , it was so hard for me to hold back all the time we were at table . i must cry , or my heart will break . oh , my own dear phil , what if i should never see you again ! oh ! oh !
0	of course , if you wish to , it is not worth the trouble , though .
0	there are no sheep here , i tell you , " i can not argue the matter at this hour of the night , " said bertie , and began hastily rummaging in the chest of drawers . shirts and underwear went flying on to the floor .
0	he will not be scared by the saddler . europeans of his order take no account of our american class distinctions . they look upon us as low-born parvenues , all alike . they weigh and value us by other standards than birth . " i have not said that i had decided , " replied lucy calmly .
0	not skilfully enough now to take place against you , will , i am atrembling yet . i had thought to see the blue sky no more --
0	that talk does not go with us , not for a minute , colonel dodd , you ' re talking to business men , not to children . we offered to leave the matter of our plan to any three engineers in this state . why is it that stone & adams refuse to take the word of anybody except your man , snell ?
0	what ? " he will take us right enough , " i declared , " and rejoice at the chance . hourra ! hourra ! hourra " ! i sprang up and clapped him on the back . " my friend , if that woman had thrown herself away on georges it might have been a national calamity " .
0	obstinate dog ! thou shalt either speak , or i will hang thee from the top of this tower , as i hanged mark fytton the butcher , " i have already told your highness that my mouth is sealed by an oath of secrecy , " replied tristram , humbly , but firmly .

0	madman ! show me the way ! show me the way down from this place or i will strangle you !
0	yes , mounted on a fine horse , and the empress and her pretty daughter in a state carriage . and willard went to some sort of review with the ambassador and was presented to the kaiser who asked him about annapolis , and some of the training . he thought the great emperor very affable . father has been at a few of the functions and seen the royal ladies in their state dresses . then , there are some splendid professors and scientists -- " and , oh , did you see the kaiser " ?
0	the duke ! " what do you want " ? asked a voice .
0	but , excellency , in london we are safe ; it is the one refuge to which our friends can come . if such a thing should happen , what would be our fate ? we could not meet together . we should be hounded down by the police from morning until night ; we should be deported -- it would be the ruin of the great movement .
0	no ? " a goddess . but she will not be you " .
0	we afford a practical example and forgive them , do we not ? " merthyr , merthyr " ! went lady gosstre ; lady charlotte murmuring aloud : " and in the third chapter of the book of paradox you will find these words " .
0	here , now , you just let this feller and plantchette fight it out together !
0	they are safe -- the precious stones of hiram , and the sword of solomon ! three other stores have i like this one -- in india , in egypt , in jerusalem -- and there is the tomb by sidon . oh , i shall not come to want ! the master made two trips ; the first one , he took the gurglet in ; the second , he took the mantle wrapping the sword . at the end , he rubbed his hands in self-congratulation .
0	there 's for the rebelly sign , there 's for dumouriez ! there 's the way we treat damned french and irish croppies .

0	yes , three years ! it cannot be helped , aunt . and the rest of it ; neither can that be helped . three years ! say thirty , aunt .
0	why , how can a tiny fish help such a great girl as i am ? " thank you , dear child ; i will not forget , but will help you some day , " said the fish , when he had taken a good drink , and felt better .

0	modest i see , they say that all great men are . but you can not get anyone in this town to take such a slighting view of it as you do yourself .
0	perhaps ; but i ' d love you while i did it . " you are uncivilized . would you beat me when i did not obey " ? she asked tremulously .
0	you will have to be careful , aunt nancy . that little girl has an inquiring mind , " you said class -- "
0	well , for that matter i am a coin dealer and not an antiquarian or a numismatist . is there anything in that way that i can do for you ?
0	you had better know it if i am going to introduce you as scobbs himself , " scobbs , " said the lawyer slowly . " i seem to know that name " .
0	well , i will tell you . those spirits of yours wore my kaross , i saw you with the boers , and saw , too , that you were of another people -- the people of the english . you may have heard at the time that i was doctoring at the great place , although i kept out of the way and we did not meet , or at least you never knew that we met , for you were -- asleep . also i pitied your youth , for , although you do not believe it , i had a little bit of heart left in those days . also i knew that we should come together again in the after years , as you see we have done to-day and shall often do until the end . so i told dingaan that whoever died you must be spared , or he would bring up the ' people of george ' [ i.e. the english ] to avenge you , and your ghost would enter into him and pour out a curse upon him . he believed me who did not understand that already so many curses were gathered about his head that one more or less made no matter . so you see you were spared , macumazahn , and afterwards you helped to pour out a curse upon dingaan without becoming a ghost , which is the reason why panda likes you so well to-day , panda , the enemy of dingaan , his brother . you remember the woman who helped you ? well , i made her do so . how did it go with you afterwards , macumazahn , with you and the boer maiden across the buffalo river , to whom you were making love in those days ?

0	your practical mind naturally seeks a practical explanation , but i myself have other theories . then in addition to the charms of sedgemoor -- haunted sedgemoor -- on a fine day it is quite possible to see the ruins of glastonbury abbey from here ; and glastonbury abbey , as you may know , is closely bound up with the history of alchemy . it was in the ruins of glastonbury abbey that the adept kelly , companion of dr . dee , discovered , in the reign of elizabeth , the famous caskets of st . dunstan , containing the two tinctures .
0	well , then , get busy and discover it , " you are right , " admitted shaggy ; " but i did not say we could not get to him . we have only to discover the way , and that was the matter we were considering when you and your magnificent army arrived here " .

0	it was the funniest thing i have ever seen , that dog acted exactly like a royal princess entertaining a happy-go-lucky jackie . rhody 's life on board the _rhode island_ since you and ralph rescued him seems to have been one gay and festive experience for a boston bull pup .
0	last time you only felt my fist ! next time you shall feel _this ! _
0	run ! it 's a wheeler !
0	stop ! just then the farmer who had been running down the hill saw us .

0	oh , there you are ! out of the frying-pan into the fire ! or rather -- for you escaped the fagots at notre dame -- out of the fire into the frying-pan !
0	it was my fault , if i had not said we made it ourselves , she would have bought it . oh , girls , let me go home and make labels . i do not like this selling , much .

0	thank you , pearson . well , i will try ; but i do get wishing and bothering of nights . " yes , he is a pretty little lad , " said pearson , returning the photograph ; " and now , tom , mind my word : i am an old fellow compared to you , and i will give you a bit of advice . the little lad is safe , at any rate , in the workhouse ; he 's got food and clothes , and you could not give him that ; so be content , and try to do your own duty . if you get a good character , instead of being always had up for sulking or fighting , that 's the best chance for you , and , after you , for willy . as for the lads ' teasing , why , be a bit hard of hearing , and before many years , i warrant , you will be having willy aboard ship as boy , when you ' re an able-bodied seaman " .

0	of course , that 's all you ' re boss of anyway , tom .
0	lord , no . i guess he had trunks and trunks full of better ones . i guess queens and empresses wrote to him . ronald pursued his idea . " where _are_ all your letters , i wonder ? were not they returned to you at his death " ?
0	yes . you would like it very much . it 's the last and greatest obstacle between you and happiness . once clear that , and -- " i wonder if i should like it if i did " ! said the squire .
0	you have said that two or three times already , but i assure you that i ' m quite sane . i loved you the first moment i ever saw you , but , of course , you will not believe it . however , that does not matter -- you have not answered my question . will you marry me ? " you must be mad " .
0	when i first saw your picture , and when i saw you afterwards , i loved your gracious quietness . now you seem to have got rid of it , i love you better as you are . there is , however , one thing i must ask again , and it 's your clear duty to tell me . are you fonder of gregory than you feel you ever could be of me ? " so far as i am concerned , you seem to believe it is the only one " . then her anger seemed to carry her away . " oh , " she said , " do you imagine that an offer of the kind you have made me , made as you have made it , would lead anyone to love you " ?
0	oh , goloptious ! you have found out the very thing i meant to tell you . i meant to ask you fellows to help me .

0	what have you been doing with yourself to get so tired ? " yes , i seem to have come to the end . i wish i were a watch , and could run down and rest for a few days and be wound up again " .
0	we ' re warranted harmless . " do not manufacture bombs here , do you " ?
0	halt ! " let me out ! let me out of here " !
0	i think you are too sensitive , i want you to unburden yourself to me , my dear chap , and tell me anything you can that will help me to clear up this mystery .
0	and that is positively ' no error , ' for once heavy was so troubled that she could not eat .
0	why should i expect you ? on the contrary , i ' m waiting to know why you ' re here ? loder came forward . " you expected me " ? he said , guardedly . a sudden conviction filled him that it was not the evidence of her eyes , but something at once subtler and more definite , that prompted her recognition of him .
0	i have felt like that about risky jobs i took . sometimes i lit out , and sometimes i did not , but found out afterward i was right either way . if you feel you have to go , the best thing you can do is to get a move on . " yes , " said dick , thoughtfully ; " i believe i was . as a matter of fact , i do not know why i stopped " .
0	oh , i do not want any of your impudence , " if i am , you would not expect me to grow confidential about it , would you " ? asked hank , grinning into the other 's face .

0	it was not on account of any wishes of ours , dad , we fairly had the extra excitement thrust on us .
0	susan dear ! where are you going ?
0	i feel rather that way myself . i feel very sure of the friendliness of your country . because of course we -- france and england -- never would dream of attacking the central powers unless first assailed . do not you think , mr . neeland , that it might be safer to entrust those -- that box , i mean -- to the captain of the royal mail steamer , _volhynia_ ?

0	the russians are upon us ! here are the russians ! the words were scarcely out of his mouth before the whole group hurried to the ruins of the bridge . a crowd of men began to pick up iron clamps and to hunt for planks and ropes -- for all the materials for a raft , in short . a score of armed men and officers , under command of the major , stood on guard to protect the workers from any desperate attempt on the part of the multitude if they should guess their design . the longing for freedom , which inspires prisoners to accomplish impossibilities , cannot be compared with the hope which lent energy at that moment to these forlorn frenchmen .
0	but why , why , why ? " no , mistress margaret , " said the boy .

0	science was not against you , mrs . godwin . ignorance was against you . and your intuition does not go contrary to science this time , either .

0	now master roughbeard , better that ! again did he gain the center , amid the cries and jubilations of stuteley and the old retainer .
0	what a funny old thing ! the little man who watched was dressed in an ill-fitting frock coat , trousers which seemed too long , since they concertinaed over his boots , and a glossy silk hat set at the back of his head .
0	that 's a sure thing ! we reckoned we were fixed well and had better stop with a boss we knew . besides , now we have a dame for commissary , the hash is pretty good .

0	foulez-fous fous rendre ? oui ou non ? " will you parley " ? i asked , listening intently for the gallop of my promised gendarmes . if i could only gain time and save buckhurst . he was there in the carriage ; i had seen him spring into it when the germans burst in among the trees .
0	hooray ! come in . the water 's great !
0	what 's your name ? " because we can not find them , sir " .
0	do not be frightened , we no longer take prisoners of war ; yet , for the sake of old acquaintance , i claim you to partake of our feast .
0	that 's different , i thought you were trying to jolly me with the name of a new drink .
0	ah ! you always prefer this place to bracondale -- eh ? it is but natural , because you are among your own people .
0	and if i yield , you will be wanting another and another kiss , and at last not get away at all . no , no , my friend -- i am the wiser of us two . now go into the dark room , i will look out and see whether the people are gone in again , and whether you can get off unseen from the street window , for you have been here much too long already . do you hear ? i command you .
0	i ' m delighted to have an opportunity to show off my pale blue chiffon frock , i have been in ecstasies over it ever since it was made . have you seen that white gown of elfreda 's ? it 's perfectly stunning . i stopped in her room for a minute last night . she was trying it on . it 's the prettiest gown she 's had since she came here . ask her to show it to you .
0	one move and i will blow your brains out , like lightning , frank 's left hand shot out and gripped the man by the collar . with his right , he yanked his automatic pistol from his belt and clapped it against the man 's temple .

0	oh , i guess henderson 's all right . but i would not wonder if it meant a squeeze . of course if he 's extended , it 's an excuse for settling up , and the shorts will squeal . i have seen henderson extended a good many times , do not you worry about him .
0	mr . bast , you ' re a born adventurer , no professional athlete would have attempted what you have done . it 's a wonder your walk did not end in a broken neck . whatever did your wife say ?
0	does going to mexico constitute liberty ? i assure you i am closely constrained by my vows wherever i am , -- as closely as though i were shut in our turret among the heights of caucasus ! i am going to mexico solely to receive some manuscripts from one of our brethren , who is dying there . he has lived as a recluse , like elzear of melyana , and to him have been confided certain important chronicles , which must be taken into trustworthy hands for preservation . such is the object of my journey . but now , tell me , have you thoroughly understood all i have said to you ?
0	i have seen it , a woman in white down the hall !
0	no , i can not ! and that appears to be my only chance , for i can not see a trace of the trees which formed the square .
0	not much , it 's the other way around , mart . well , we sail monday morning . old jerry is getting a crew for us and he will come aboard sunday night with the men . you ' d better quit work at the shop to-night , get our wireless in shape over to-morrow , to pass the port inspectors , and rest up sunday . i will detail bob to help you -- he 's been acting as supercargo up to date .
0	what is the matter ? " u -- u " ! shouted jan . in vain ! netteke would not move . marie held a handful of fresh grass just out of reach of her mouth . but netteke was really offended . she made no effort to get it . she simply stayed where she was . father de smet stuck his head over the side of the boat .
0	come down with us ! the captain remained on board .
0	will you answer my question , man ? " sure , sir , you will not be after -- "
0	a sure sign he 's in love . i hope i will get such a helpful husband . " i will go and see if he 's come , " said mandy . " he often drops in and helps mrs . crowley clear up after supper " .

0	it 's old surley ! it 's old surley ! our friends cannot be far-off .
0	very well , the bet is off if you like .
0	i do not think i should . it feels a little cramped , you know , after a new country . but it has its attractions . " you would not like to settle here again " ?
0	that 's not all , look !
0	oh , hush ! ca not you stay on earth one day ?
0	no , its tainted with fraud from the beginning .
0	oh , of course , and it was great fun , " how did you manage in the bush ? did you have to camp out " ? asked hil , with an appearance of great interest , and gently touching may 's foot .
0	the captain promised to let us go some day , and we could not have a better opportunity , the ship was in sight of a rocky island . three of the boats had already gone away in pursuit of a whale in an opposite direction from the island , the captain himself being in one of them , when another was seen spouting towards the land . the boat of which old tom had charge was immediately lowered . harry and dickey , who had long been eager to go in chase of a whale , slipped down just as she was shoving off . the first mate , who remained in charge of the ship , hailed them to come back .
0	aw , let somebody have a game , and we need this one !
0	well , what are you waiting for ? catch hold .
0	wha-at ? louder !
0	you are safe in saying so , the opportunity being lacking . " i will guarantee our friend here could do no better , if he sat up all night , " put in dicky satirically .
0	dat settles it , golly , i reckon dis nigger goin ' to show you chillens how to shoot some . my shot , i seed him first .
0	per dio ! if taxes are not reduced i shall be forced to some such expedient , it was my mother 's home , it is my birthplace , so i love it -- even though i neglect it . as you perceive , it is high time i took a wife . but enough ! if you are lacking in appetite , i am not , and francesca is an unbearable tyrant when her meals grow cold .
0	how you do order me about ! " stop " ! said barbara , in an authoritative tone . " never mind tandy 's character . if you go off on that you will never make me understand " .
0	the secret hand will smite ! " we will take her down , do not worry yourself " ! smiled dulcie . " we must just wait for a good opportunity , and then -- "
0	come on , scouts ! if they do not stop crowding and pushing , not one of these people will get out of this place alive .
0	ah ! and what about the dutchman ?
0	the proprieties , you know , " i cannot tell you yet , darling , just how we vanquished the old ogre , " said he . " be brave , and remember that a feast of long-deferred love-tidings awaits you to-night . i have already sent away all my own luggage . a horse and a well-mounted orderly will be here at four , and so i shall not lose you from sight even a moment until you are safe in general wragge 's home at edgemere . let the maid return alone here to-morrow and remove all your effects we may overlook . i will dispatch the luggage and ride after your carriage " .
0	i wish to goodness she had , " with such a combination of qualities as she will probably develop , she ' d much better have stayed in her convent , " the elder woman went on .

0	say ahead ! the fact that the brigadier had sent no message other than the sword was probably the rajput 's chief reason for talking in riddles still to cunningham . the silence went straight to his oriental heart -- so to speak , set the key for him to play to . but he knew , too , that cunningham 's youth would be a handicap should it come to argument ; what he was looking for was not a counsellor or some one to make plans , for the plans had all been laid and cross-laid by the enemy , and mahommed gunga knew it . he needed a man of decision -- to be flung blindfold into unexpected and unexpecting hell wrath , who would lead , take charge , decide on the instant , and lead the way out again , with men behind him who would recognize decision when they saw it . so he spoke darkly . he understood that the sword meant " things have started , " so with a soldier 's courage he proceeded to head cunningham toward the spot where hell was loose .
0	i ' m not worrying , i only wanted to be sure it was suitable and all that .
0	grip him well , boy , norman hesitated for a moment naturally enough , for it was mounting a bare-backed unbroken colt ; but the next minute he had accepted a leg up , and was in his place , with the result that the beautiful creature reared right up , pawing the air , and threatened to fall over backwards .
0	i meant you to marry me , when you saved my life from the streetcar . i never saw but one man i wanted to marry , and you are that man , carnac . you would not ask me , so i made you marry me . you could go farther and fare worse . come , take me home -- take me home , my love . i want you to love me . " i will believe nothing but the worst of you ever . i will fight the thing out , by god " !
0	no , no ! i ' m up in the pines , i ai not here .
0	methinks , beric , you need not fear on that score . since the day when you fought the lion in the arena you have been her hero and the lord of her heart . even i , although but short sighted as to matters unconnected with my work , could mark that , and i believe it is because her mother sees and fears it that she has determined to marry her to rufinus . i will call her down to find out whether she is ready to obey my wishes . " i cannot raise my sword against caesar , for , however foul his crimes , he has treated me well . had it not been for that i would have made for praeneste , when the gladiators rose there the other day , and for the same reason i can do nothing to prepare the way for a rising here . i know the ludus of scopus would join to a man . there is great discontent among the other schools , for the people have become so accustomed to bloodshed that they seem steeled to all pity , and invariably give the signal for the despatch of the conquered . as to your offer , norbanus , i thank you with all my heart ; but were it not for this danger that threatens from rufinus , i would say that at the present time i dare not link her lot to mine . the danger is too great , the future too dark . it seems to me that the city and all in it are seized with madness , and above all , at the present time , i would not for worlds take her to the palace of nero . but if aemilia will consent to a betrothal to me , putting off the period of marriage until the times are changed , i will , with delight , accept the offer of her hand , if she too is willing , for in briton , as in gaul , our maidens have a voice in their own disposal " .
0	hardly , but i can tell by looking at that light coat you have on that you went to sleep in your chair last night , with the lower part wrinkled up under you ! did you sleep that way all night ? own up , now !

0	oh , you do not understand , you do not understand ! i wanted to catch silva . i guessed that he was coming north on one of his blackmailing trips , and i followed him .
0	from what i was taught , it seems to me that she moves round in rings . you start with the luxury of the few , oppression , and brutality , then comes revolution , and worse things than you had before , progress growing out of it that lasts for a few generations until the few fittest get more than their fair share of wealth and control , and you come back to the same point again . " der progress , " said muller , " she is irresistible " .

0	i suppose i should introduce myself before matters go any further , i know you , but you do not know me . you are the pony rider boys . i am captain billy mckay of the rangers .
0	you almost wish it might , as a judgment on me , " and it will , mark my word , it will " .
0	and glad , glad to have your husband back once more , eh ?
0	dear me ! good gracious ! why ! i thought you ' d gone off with mr . thornton . what in the world are you going to do ? let the poor boy alone !
0	not quite so far as that , " i think we must be almost up to albany , " i said to kate , as i glanced out at the window .

0	you and i happen to be , locally , in the minority with our opinions , that 's all .

0	what ? have you remembered that yesterday i came of age , and am , therefore , no more your ward , if such i ever was ? you should have sold my inheritance more swiftly , for now the title you can give is rotten as last year 's apples , and i will sign nothing . bear witness , mother matilda , and you , emlyn stower , that i have signed and will sign nothing . clement maldon , abbot of blossholme , i am a free woman of full age , even though , as you say , i am a wanton . where is your right to chain up a wanton who is no religious ? unlock these gates and let me go .
0	how thinks of god ? how does he live for his soul ? " oh , well , of course , folks are different . one man lives for his own wants and nothing else , like mituh , he only thinks of filling his belly , but fokanitch is a righteous man . he lives for his soul . he does not forget god " .

0	we might organize a society -- they have them for nearly everything now -- for saying pleasant things to young ladies with a view to the moral effect . " how lovely of you , even if you do not mean it , " she sighed . " if girls could have more of those things said to them , they would be better , do not you think ? or at least feel better " .
0	you are exceedingly good , sir , to credit me with a conscience ! i do not think i have one , -- i ' m sure i have no passions . i have always been too lazy to encourage them , and as for moral law , -- i adhere to morality with the greatest strictness , because if a fellow is immoral , he ceases to be a gentleman . now , as there are very few gentlemen nowadays , i fancy i ' d like to be one as long as i can . g ldmar laughed . " you are an odd lad , " he said good-humoredly . " you are in the morning of life ; there are always mists in the morning as there are in the evening . in the light of your full manhood you will see these things differently . your creed of nothing provides no moral law , -- no hold on the conscience , no restraint on the passions , -- do not you see that " ?
0	jump for your life ! just in time i realized the danger into which we were being unwittingly drawn , and reversing the gear , i put on both breaks . i was in time , but only just in time , for we were on a treacherous grassy slope and in spite of the breaks our car continued to glide forward under the impulse of the velocity it had attained .
0	well , it 's a cause that we have all got to respect ; but i do not see why _you_ should go , ben , as i said before . it would do very well for some young fellow who had no settled prospects , but you have got your duties here . i presume you looked at it in that light . as you said in your letter , you have fooled away so much time on leather and law -- " oh , undoubtedly , miss halleck , " said olive .

0	hello ! mr . b -- , i did not want to think of andy personally . intuition whispered to me that the swagman , who would have parted his last sprat to a former mate , had not that humble coin in his pocket ; whilst purse-pride hinted that i had four sovereigns and some loose silver in mine -- not to speak of 8 6s . 8d . waiting for me in hay . if i had allowed my mind to dwell on these two intrusive intimations , they would have seemed to fit each other like tenon and mortice ; though when the opportunity of making the joint had existed , a sort of moral laziness , together with our artificial , yet not unpraiseworthy , repugnance to offering a money gift , had brought me out rather a levite than a samaritan . in mere self-defence , i would have been constrained to keep up a series of general and impersonal reflections till the swagman lost his individuality -- say , five or six hours -- but i was rescued from this tyranny by the faint rattle of a buggy on the other side of the river . idly turning my glass on the two occupants of the vehicle , i recognised one of them as a familiar and valued friend -- a farmer , residing five or six miles down the river , on the victorian side . i rose and walked to the brink as the buggy came opposite .

0	who is up ? our eight expected to make seven bumps , and succeeded in making five of them , with which jack , who rowed six , pretended to be discontented . but we celebrated those five bumps all right , and altogether the college was a splendid place to live in . i stayed in bed much later than usual on the morning after our second celebration , and i suppose every one else was sleepy , for i could hear clarkson calling his boy a lazy young vagabond , and that always happened when through other people 's laziness the unfortunate boy could not get on with his work .
0	how do i know where they are ? do you know what blackjacks are ?
0	with her ! do you mean to say ? that is a poor return for the hospitality which was shown to you by my parents and of which you formally sang the praises . i am a good-natured fellow and will submit to more from you than from any other man -- i know not why , myself ; -- but in a matter like this i do not understand a joke ! my sister is the only daughter of the noblest and richest house in corinth and has many suitors . she is in no respect inferior to the child of your own parents , and i should like to know what you would say if i made so bold as to compare the proud lucretia with this poor little thing , who carries water like a serving-maid .
0	we must go and look in the cottage of severin 's wife . then he related at length his troubles with polyte , his leaving his service , his bad reputation , things which had been told him , accumulating insignificant and minute proofs , and then , the brigadier , who had been listening very attentively while he emptied his glass and filled it again with an indifferent air , turned to his gendarme and said :

0	a lucky thing that i knew you a little while ago , or you would have made mincemeat of me , after all ! " change ! you may well say so ! one moment howling peter -- and the next , the strongest man on board ! there you have the whole story ! for look here now , at sea , of course , it was just the same ; even the ship 's boy felt obliged to give me a kick on the shins in passing . everybody who got a blow on a rowing passed it on to me . and when i went to sea in an american bark , there was a nigger on board , and all of them used to hound him down ; he crawled before them , but you may take your oath he hated them out of the whites of his devil 's eyes . but me , who treated him with humanity , he played all manner of tricks on -- it was nothing to him that i was white . yet even with him i did not dare to fetch him one -- there was always like a flabby lump in my midriff . but once the thing went too far -- or else the still-born something inside me was exhausted . i just aimed at him a bit with one arm , so that he fell down . that really was a rummy business . it was , let 's say , like a fairy tale where the toad suddenly turns into a man . i set to then and there and thrashed him till he was half dead . and while i was about it , and in the vein , it seemed best to get the whole thing over , so i went right ahead and thrashed the whole crew from beginning to end . it was a tremendous moment , there was such a heap of rage inside me that had got to come out " !

0	hallo ! wait ! suppose they found themselves bound and gagged , and tied to trees , while some dastardly ruffians hewed down the best timber in the wood ? the shouts behind grew nearer . their pursuer was evidently gaining upon them . through the pouring rain they struggled on , splashing anyhow through swampy places , regardless of soaked shoes and stockings , pushing through wet bushes and underneath dripping branches , possessed by the one idea of flight . down through the hollow where they had gathered the forget-me-nots , and up the bluebell bank they struggled , with never a thought for the flowers ; and they were just about to scramble over some felled trees when raymonde , who was a yard in advance , caught her foot in a tangle of brier and fell on her hands and knees among the springing bracken . fauvette , unable to stop herself , collided heavily and collapsed by her side . too much out of breath to stir , the girls lay for a few moments panting .

0	and yet , you are beginning to feel that there is not as much reason for suspecting us as there is for believing that the guilt of a mean theft lies at someone else 's door .
0	well ? " well , we must have patience " ! he said to himself . he then went to the sledge to get some tinder , and asked johnson for his steel , telling him that the fire had gone out . johnson answered that it was his fault , and he put his hand in his pocket , where he usually kept it ; he was surprised not to find it there . he felt in his other pockets with the same success ; he went into the snow-house and examined carefully the covering under which he had slept in the previous night , but he could not find it .
0	oh ! i know every inch of the place of old , " have you been over there " ? amazedly cried blunt .
0	in fact you made a little romance , in which you acted the part of sapient brother , and the poor little sister broke her heart ever after ! you wanted such an entertainment when you were lying on the sofa , so you created a heroine and a villain , and thundered down to the rescue .

0	no one knows that better than i do ! but speaking simply as a woman , i know also that the man who opens our eyes to the passionate side of things involves himself in a big moral responsibility . and even _you_ cannot shelve the moralities altogether . " i have no concern with ' unless end_sentence_quote such uncomfortable words are wiped out of my vocabulary . they affect me like a false note in music " .

0	contact ! " ready " ! he cried .
0	by gosh ! ' tis him ! " bud " ! cried nort and dick in a duet as they spurred their horses forward . " bud " !
0	i do not believe he goes serenading much . he says in one letter that the mexican ladies are said to be very beautiful , but that do not seem to me very warm praise . marie pulled a dark purple silk necktie from her workbasket .

0	lower away the boat , " this is my fault , " said young jack , and seizing a cutlass , he leaped overboard .
0	you betrayed yourself , my friend ; or , if you prefer it , my worldly wisdom and cunning betrayed you . my young and innocent friend , a man like pollnitz is not easily deceived ; his eyes are sharp enough to pierce the veil of the most charming little intrigue , and probe it to the bottom ! i know the princess amelia ; i have known her too long , not to know that she would not so quickly , and without a struggle , sacrifice her love ; and further when i saw at the last court-ball , with what a long and dreary face you stood behind the chair of the poor marwitz , and with what calm and smiling content the princess watched the couple amoureuse , look you , trenck , then i knew and understood all . " i see it is in vain , " said trenck , sighing ; " you know all : but if you have any real friendship for me , you will tell me who betrayed us " .
0	no , " to uncle daniel 's at meadow brook " .

0	come back , you madman ! at the last word , before anyone was aware of his intentions , this son of erin , whose blood was now up , sprang down the cliffs towards the bears , flourishing his stick , and shouting wildly as he went . the bears instantly paused in their game , but showed no disposition to retreat .
0	well , well , there is something in that . i remember that iny first political experience was in trying to defeat a supervisor who did not properly work the roads of his district ; but i had never thought that in so doing i was illustrating such a doctrine as you have put forth .
0	ever get it back ? " well , " the gambler fenced , " i have loaned him money " .
0	france ! your majesty would surely not marry me to the horrid old louis xv .
0	it was not lack of intelligence , but a sense of honour -- yes , a sense of honour , what do you think might be my reason for concealing the will -- if i did conceal it ?
0	come on ! a wild cheer rose into the air from the crowd below us . all eyes were riveted on the activity about norton 's biplane . they were doing something to it . whatever it was , it was finished in a minute and the men were standing again at a respectful distance from the propellers . again norton was in the air . as he rose above the field kennedy gave a last glance at his ondometer and sprang down the ladder . i followed closely . back of the crowd he hurried , down the walk to the entrance near the railroad station . the man in charge of the pinkertons was at the gate with two other men , apparently waiting .
0	well , perhaps ! yet one would run the risk of that for the sake of a perfect rose .
0	a selfish motive , ishmael ! i do not believe that you are capable of entertaining one , " sir , " said the young man , blushing slightly , " a selfish motive has brought me to your side this afternoon " .

0	no , that would spoil everything . do not make a move until i get at the real truth of this affair .
0	two hundred puds ! that is russian-like , young man ! i shall directly notify the peasants of your gift . you will see how grateful they will be -- how glad . yefim looked cautiously at the young master , spreading out and smacking his lips , while the master with an air of pride on his face listened to the quick-witted speech of the receiver , who was pressing his hand firmly .
0	we are resolved to do so , after a long pause hofer raised his head again . " and now , men , listen to what i have to say to you , " he exclaimed , cheerfully . " i have invited you all because you are the most influential and respectable men in this part of the country , and because the fatherland has need of you and counts upon you and me . the sharpshooters of the passeyrthal told me , if war should break out , i must be their captain ; and i accepted the position because i think that every one is in duty bound to risk his limbs and life for the sake of the fatherland , and place himself just where he can serve it best . but if i am to be your captain , you must all assist me to the best of your power . we must act harmoniously , and strain every nerve to deliver the fatherland and restore the tyrol to our beloved emperor " .
0	he 's slim , this little englishman , all the company of boers who stood around began to laugh also , uproariously , for this primitive joke appealed to them . moreover , their nerves were strained ; they also dreaded this expedition , and therefore they were glad to relieve themselves in bucolic merriment . everything was clear to them now . feeling myself in honour bound to go on the embassy , as i was their only interpreter , i , artful dog , was trying to play upon their fears in order to prevent it from starting , so that i might have a week or two of the company of my new-wed wife . they saw and appreciated the joke .

0	good idea ! but tying is better all round .
0	the curse of allah upon thee ! has this presumptuous hellcat who bore thee taught thee to stand before my face , to tell me what thou wilt and wilt not do ? by the koran ! too long have i endured her evil foreign ways , and now it seems she has taught thee how to tread them after her and how to beard thy very father ! to-morrow thou ' lt take the sea with sakr-el-bahr , i have said it . another word and thou ' lt go aboard his galeasse even as thou saidst should be the case with him -- at the rowers ' bench , to learn submission under the slave master 's whip .

0	that is news to me . i understand you have been riding together . he is really a splendid horseman .
0	down with that fore staysail , look alive man and set the topsail at once !
0	do you hear ? " dare ! act directs ! you rascally lawyer , you ! and whence does an ostler like you get your shilling to pay withal ? answer me " . the examinate found it so difficult to answer the question , that he suddenly became afflicted with deafness .
0	oh , you silly , you ' re thinking of vivisection . i would not cut up anything alive for all the world . the girls did dissect crabs and lobsters , and even rabbits , last year , but they were dead long before they ever reached the zo logy class .
0	certainly , mother , if i get a chance . my vision is not impaired in the least , " can you see two young ladies , richard " ? asked mrs . prescott , looking into the room .

0	light ? i feel gay ! with fulkerson at the helm , i tell you the rocks and the lee shore had better keep out of the way . just when you think fulkerson has taken leave of his senses he says or does something that shows he is on the most intimate and inalienable terms with them all the time . you know how i have been worrying over those foreign periodicals , and trying to get some translations from them for the first number ? well , fulkerson has brought his centipedal mind to bear on the subject , and he 's suggested that old german friend of mine i was telling you of -- the one i met in the restaurant -- the friend of my youth .

0	give her the topsail , ole . when the four boats were near enough together for a man to pass from one to another , one greek from each of three got into the nearest boat to us , taking his rifle with him . this made five in the foremost boat , and it was plain that their intention was to board us . this they undertook to do , by main strength and sweat , running hand over hand the float-line of a net . and though it was slow , and they stopped frequently to rest , they gradually drew nearer .

0	and waters is really clear ? " you see , doctor , how unjust were your surmises in regard to this girl , " continued mr . gray . " but let that pass now . at the conclusion of her story , i offered to go with her to this ali baba cave . it was no easy job finding the concealed entrance , but i found it at last , and ample corroboration of every item of this wild story . the pocket is rich with the most valuable ore . it has evidently been worked for some time since the discovery was made , but there is still a fortune in its walls , and several thousand dollars of ore sacked up in its galleries . look at that " ! continued mr . gray , as he drew an oblong mass of quartz and metal from his pocket . " think of a secret of this kind having been intrusted for three weeks to a penniless orphan girl of twelve and an eccentric schoolboy of ten , and undivulged except when a proper occasion offered " .
0	it is necessary always to allow for deflection , apparently it takes a would-be poet to write a successful comic opera .

0	you could spare a few -- and not miss them ! " spare my blushes , geoffrey " !
0	farewell , my social ambitions ! dear countess , pray do not scold ! i could not help it . why must the very respectable world see only the sins of the unfortunate , and save all their charity for the heads with coronets ? maman is not like that ; she is always gentle with the people who have never been taught goodness ; though she is severe on those who disgrace good training . i like her way best ; and alain ? well , he only told me to do my own thinking , to be sure i was right before i spoke , and to let no other consideration weigh at all .

0	you must indeed have your cap in your hand , walter ; but you need not bear yourself in that spirit . the ' prentice of a london citizen may have just as much honest pride and independence as the proudest earl at westminster ; but carry not independence too far . remember that if you yourself had received a great service you would be hurt if the donor refused to receive your thanks ; and it would be churlish indeed were you to put on sullen looks , or to refuse to accept any present which the lady whose life you have saved may make you . it is strange , indeed , that it should be dame vernon , whose husband , sir jasper vernon , received the fiefs of westerham and hyde . " that is the worst of an adventure , " walter said crossly , after the retainer had departed . " one can not have a bit of excitement without being sent for , and thanked , and stared at . i would rather fight the best swordsman in the city than have to go down to the mansion of earl talbot with my cap in my hand " .

0	when we take new york , we will need more men than congress ever has got together , i ' m thinkin ' . i was there when washington tried to hold it , because congress an ' the country expected him to do the impossible . but , colonel , i will say as how if you led the way , thar ' d not be one of ' em , as ever marched with morgan , who would not be at yer back .
0	you will have the irons , fellow ! " you are great friends , eh , all together " ? he said viciously . " all together you will get the gold . it is no matter what one english do , the other absolve for gold . a buccaneer , a stealer of women -- no , it is no matter ! all english -- all together ! but i am french -- i am the dirt -- i am for the scuppers . bah ! i will have the same as bucklaw -- you see " ?
0	clumsy lout ! did not i tell you to stand out of the way and not go near the ball -- you idiot ! go and play back , do .
0	are you sure now ? " i -- was not quite sure " .
0	tom rover ! are you certain of this ?
0	and i will be coachman , it will be the old times come round again . do you remember , father , my breaking the pole , one moonlight night , and your not letting me drive for six months afterwards ?
0	then to hell with you ! " i both smoked and chewed in my lifetime , " i faltered , " but " .
0	liking folks kinder shines ' em up , same as furniture polish , honey-bird , you ' re a-rubbing some on me and tom mayberry . but he were the best favored baby i ' most ever saw , if i do say it , as should not .
0	if you took that up the wrong way i ' m sorry . she ought to work off on the port track , and when we have open water to leeward you can heave her to . when it moderates we can pick up the beach again . the skipper swung around on him with a flash in his eyes . " the bonus " ! he repeated . " who was it came for you with two dollars in his pocket after he ' d bought his ticket from vancouver " ?
0	part of them , " am i speaking to the page twins " ! a voice asked .
0	you are always the same , you sweep me away from myself and from everything . i have never seen any one like you . there are people everywhere . father is somewhere close by .
0	i do not know , unless just by loving you , for i loved you hard enough to melt the heart of a stone , much less the heart of the living , breathing woman you are .
0	you will _not_ go ! leave the dog t ' die !
0	it 's going to be the biggest race i have ever run , and we have got to win . if we do not --
0	so i do not respect you , my angel ? then you know what you can do ! the door 's open and there 's few will miss you !
0	sylvia , i am here ! i -- owen biddulph ! where are you ?
0	i did nothing of the kind , " it was the way he said it , " cora protested , sobbing . " he meant something he did not _say_ . he did ! he did ! he _meant_ to insult me " !
0	then you ' re in some danger , t . x . , for according to my account you ' re always more or less broke .
0	good ! that 's the ticket !
0	sluice number six has busted , and the water 's going in over hudson 's ranch , i have started all the men there 's room for heaving dirt in , but the river 's going through in spite of them .
0	oh , i am , am i ? say that again , will you ?
0	pooh ! that 's easy ! i was telling dad the other night that inasmuch as this was the first birthday in the city and on saturday and everything -- so convenient for us all -- we ' d better do those very two things .
0	into what ? " luff ! luff hard ! down with your helm , or you will be into it " !
0	i have promised , have not i ? honour bright , max dear , you ' re the first man i ever said ' yes ' to . i hope i sha not be sorry !
0	oh , it 's got to all come out , busby . i saw the man on the sorrel horse fire that shot -- do not forget that . and i know who made the tracks in the flour . but i am beginning to wonder if you had anything to do with warning the kauffmans to get out . and busby shouted from his position in the corner on the floor , " shut up , you fool " !
0	stop , boys ! stop ! what has happened here ?
0	broke your arm ! heaven forbid . " be not concerned , madam , " answered jones . " heaven be praised you have escaped so well , considering the danger you was in . if i have broke my arm , i consider it as a trifle , in comparison of what i feared upon your account " .
0	i should say there were several of ' him , ' they seemed to be stirred up about something . are they timber wolves , anvik ?
0	it 's up there in the skies . do not you see ? " i -- i do not -- "
0	well , what is it ? in the light from the lamp in the bedroom sautee swung on his visitor and looked at him keenly . the mines manager was fully dressed , and the bed was made . it was evident that he had merely dozed on top of the covers with his clothes on . these things rathburn noted even as sautee surveyed him with a frown .
0	have you heard from t . branch ? " well -- i have had things on my mind " . her blue eyes met his , and she flushed a bit . " not things that i am sorry for , but things that i am worried about . but now -- well , i am very happy in my heart , daddy " .
0	hurrah ! down with the vampyre ! where is he ?
0	trouble ? i should say not ! wait until i saddle my horse !
0	dear me , what will mr . dalken say when he hears about his car ! i do not mind going to jail or being made to pay a hundred dollars fine , but to break up his automobile the first time i drove it , and get his license tag into trouble -- that is terrible !
0	why does not he speak ? posie began to scream .
0	why , of course ! here , ma , here 's our new hand , the very man for you .
0	ha ! pin-money ! mr . hawkes gathered up his papers and in a tone of regret ventured : " then there is nothing more to be said . i was only carrying out the dead man 's wishes by coming here and making the facts known to you . mr . kingsnorth was of the opinion that you were well provided for and , that , outside of the sentimental reason that the girl was your own niece , the additional thousand pounds a year might be welcome as , say , pin-money for your daughter " .
0	look here what i have found ! i guess it 's a shrimp . and if i had a match i ' d make a fire and cook it , for i read in a book once that shrimps are delicious .
0	how you scorned me for my ignorance , did not you ? oh , but i have learned a great many things since those days , athalie . " i think so , too . i shall not require or desire a car unless you also are to be in it . but i ' d love to possess a dobbin and a double buckboard . also i shall , in due time , purchase a sail-boat -- " she checked herself , laughed at the sudden memory , and said with delightful malice : " i suppose you have not yet learned to sail a boat , have you " ?
0	do not you believe him ; it 's gin , " how are you getting on , batchelor " ? said the former presently to me . " do not be afraid of that bottle , man , it 's only whisky " !
0	he gives you good advice , i suppose . people are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves . " dear basil ! i have not laid eyes on him for a week . it is rather horrid of me , as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame , designed by himself , and , though i am a little jealous of it for being a whole month younger than i am , i must admit that i delight in it . perhaps you had better write to him . i do not want to see him alone . he says things that annoy me " .
0	and do you think that i will let him go ? no ! i will say one word to madame raynal , and she will buy him a substitute directly .
0	wonder how he happened to leave out that one ? " you have one here that has not been recorded , " the clerk announced when he had finally finished the checking .
0	why , that she killed her father , you fool ! he ' d have been alive now but for her . it might craze her to know that .
0	look like you ? it 's your fault that you look like me ! jimmy 's grin froze on his face , became hard , and slowly changed to something very different . his well-meaning hand slowly came back as if half-paralyzed by such a reception . it had never before been rebuffed . it was a liberal hand that had gone into its pocket many times to help those in hard luck . it had never been slow in friendliness or that courtesy which prevails between well-meaning and generous hands throughout the sad old world . it had seldom been hastily raised in anger . but now it shut hard and its owner said , " so that 's the way of it , eh ? you ' re sore because i look like you . why should not i get hot under the collar because you look like me ? about the only difference between us is that you ' re a judge and i ' m a drummer . that does not keep you from being a good sport , does it ? i came a long way to get acquainted with you and i like most people . it 's not my fault that you look so much like me , is it " ?
0	you hold on there , i will turn in here anigh the mountain . you ken git by t ' other side , can not you ?
0	rosemary ! mother ! rich -- rich ! warren ! rich ! rich !
0	that is true , but i am not sure that you would make so striking subject , so inspiring to the artist . did you come all the way from the punch-bowl to see the painting ?
0	nowhere ! will you go away , or shall i strike you with my stick ?
0	you must not let prosperity corrupt you , philip . would not seeing what the press is saying of it distract you from the real aim you had in your story ? " no , that is not the turn they take . they speak of the strong love interest involved in the problem . and the abundance of incident . i looked out to keep something happening , you know . i ' m sorry i did not ask armiger to let me bring the notices home to you . i ' m not sure that i did wisely not to subscribe to that press-clippings bureau " .
0	of hell , damnation , and eternal fire , " of what " ?
0	of course he did ; if you buy a man , you must not grumble when he does a second time what you encouraged him to do in the first instance . but you were going to take us off to the rjukanfos , fifty or sixty miles out of our way , without our knowledge or consent . i smelt a mice , and turned the tables , " he sold us out , " growled sanford .
0	it seems to me , that so much education is thrown away on the stock market .
0	then it will not be drained , " it strikes me as an entirely unnecessary expense at present , " said silas and smiled again .
0	and father , is such friends with mother !
0	to brooklyn ! she will drive with me if i bring them both , i guess , will not she ?
0	hi , you stop your talking in there ! plotting to run away , i reckon . it will not do you any good . if you try it , somebody will get a dose of buckshot in the leg .
0	i ' m gangnet . i know most things . maskull stared at him , not without friendliness . " what made you expect me , and how do you know my name " ?
0	nay , in my house my business comes first . acour is my daughter 's husband and so shall stay till death or pope part them . out of this , hugh de cressi , with all your accursed chapman tribe .
0	come on , and take the guns !
0	and god go with you , " to send them to paris ? oh , i know . may i go up , marianne " ?
0	then i suppose i am , for i think mr . barth was a man of good judgment , " leopold , harvey barth said you were a very nice young man , " she added .
0	i have been having a little talk with papa triscoe , in the smoking-room . " she is not feeling at all . she 's letting her revolving light fall upon half a dozen other young men by this time , collectively or consecutively . all that she wants to make sure of is that they ' re young men -- or old ones , even " .
0	well , i declare , i did that quite as well as an actress could ! but now what am i to do ? how long can i keep this up ? heigh-ho ' let the world slide ! ' i will not reveal myself until i ' m driven to it , for when i do -- ! cap , child , you will get chawed right up !
0	what fun ! now try it on me .
0	stay where you are , suddenly father cahill appeared amongst them . " go back to your homes , " he commanded , breathlessly .
0	that 's coffee ! he tasted it an ' his face changed as though he had caught a vision of the better world , but i kept my face like the face of an angry bear . " what do you call this stuff " ? i asked the cook , an ' his face grew dark as a thunder cloud .
0	we ' re not a tough gang ! oh , what will become of us !
0	stop ! " and as for the ladies , " said wynyard with a weak , vinous laugh , " unless any of ' em is inclined to take the matter as personal -- eh " ?
0	come back , jack ! are you mad ? " stand , for your lives " ! shouted amyas : and only just in time ; for there was ten good minutes lost in running up and down before he could get his men into some order of battle . but when jack beheld the spaniards , as if he had expected their coming , he plucked a leaf and put it into the page of his book for a mark , laid the book down soberly , caught up his arquebuse , ran like a mad dog right at the spanish captain , shot him through the body stark dead , and then , flinging the arquebuse at the head of him who stood next , fell on with his sword like a very colbrand , breaking in among the arquebuses , and striking right and left such ugly strokes , that the spaniards ( who thought him a very fiend , or luther 's self come to life to plague them ) gave back pell-mell , and shot at him five or six at once with their arquebuses : but whether from fear of him , or of wounding each other , made so bad play with their pieces , that he only got one shrewd gall in his thigh , which made him limp for many a day . but as fast as they gave back he came on ; and the rest by this time ran up in good order , and altogether nearly forty men well armed . on which the spaniards turned , and went as fast as they had come , while cary hinted that , " the dogs had had such a taste of the parson , that they had no mind to wait for the clerk and people " .
0	one of the lord pope his cardinals , get thee to thine herbs and pans , little maude ; and burden not thy head with sir john de wycliffe nor john de northampton neither . fare thee well , my maid . i must after my master for the hawking .
0	of course you would not ! your idea of a story is cinderella . there has to be a girl , a prince and a wedding . is not that right ?
0	you think i give my parole to leave you sons of filth with this beautiful spanish ship , to go make war upon other spaniards ! ha ! you fool ! you can kill me . pish ! it is very well . i die with my work well done . in less than an hour you will be the prisoners of spain , and the cinco llagas will go belong to spain again .
0	what for ? to put out the bear ? " quick , get water " ! urged ned .
0	you _have_ hope . do not make a scene , was she to bear a hopeless child ?
0	you chump oferpoard und you to not know how you vos going to git pack , ai not it ! " why " ?
0	joe ! j-o-o-oe !
0	it 's really just like home , the little dinner was a great success . philip had sent in a small pot of caviare , which he knew she was very fond of , and the landlady brought them up some cutlets with vegetables and a sweet . philip had ordered burgundy , which was her favourite wine . with the curtains drawn , a bright fire , and one of mildred 's shades on the lamp , the room was cosy .
0	friend be hanged ! keep your place .
0	the boy , lord , he is a boy , ye may weel say it , quiet and smiling , and fond of throwing back the head of him and laughing . he will aye be doing that ; but there is no man will run foul o ' him , drunk or sober , in these seas , and there are bold sailor-men in the indies , ay , bold stark men . he carries a long lean sword wi ' a bonny grip -- the maiden , he will be calling her , -- she will have kissed many , they were saying . . . .
0	i suppose you heard of that silly duck fit of mine ? opening the door of his partner 's office , saunders found him seated on the lounge smoking a cigar . he was about thirty-five years of age , tall , broad-shouldered , with blue eyes , yellow mustache , and was good- looking and well built . glancing up , he smiled significantly and nodded . there were dark rings round his eyes , and the hand holding his cigar quivered nervously .
0	we have been quite friendly , " you and dakota friendly " ? he questioned again , noting langford 's nod .
0	halloa , leslie ! if you ' re about just say so , and if you ai not let us know , both took the boat , and turning it over so as to free it from water , shoved it out from the beach .
0	i will wager that you sprang first . i know why you risk your life in that way .
0	make him give me my money ! " i can explain -- " cried the judge .
0	kalman ! " well , well , callum . it iss a fery good name , whatefer " .
0	rise , tyrolese ! the french and bavarians are coming . we must prevent them from penetrating into innspruck . we must barricade the gates , and erect barricades in the streets .
0	if i had full use of both my arms i ' d show you that girls _can_ do a great deal when they like . do not be too lofty , young man , for you may have to come down , " so she may , but she wont do anything ; girls can not , though it 's good exercise and pleases them to try " .
0	we have an argument , gregg , this is sir arthur coniston , an english gentleman , lecturer and sky-trotter -- that is , he will be a sky-trotter ; he tells us he plans a number of voyages .
0	not a very cheerful place to spend a holiday , what do you say to coming a quiet drive with me ?
0	it is not what ? " oh it is not that , " mrs . brook sadly said .
0	i will try to get a piece of it , then , i will see about it while we are getting the copper .
0	and so we want only mr . bullard to make the party complete ! pity he sailed to-day for south africa ! " that , sir , is one of the instructions left me by my master . those are the names of all the people who are to be present on the night when the clock stops . i ventured to bring it to your notice now merely because it struck me as a little curious , sir , especially since mr . harvie , the lawyer , had not intended to stay the night " .
0	it is , they resent my methods . i ' m a new farmer .
0	damn him -- let him have it ! " you cur " ! cried norton , blind and dizzy , as he wheeled on him .
0	yes . dear mother , since you never have seen him , i do not know that i can hope to convey any right conception of wilde 's truly remarkable character . he is , to begin with , the best of men . picture , if you can , a nature with a soul completely beautiful and selfless , and a nervous surface quite as pachydermatous and indiscriminating as that of an ox . wilde accepts everybody 's estimate of himself . not only the quality of his mercy , but also of his admiration , is quite unstrained . so that he sees the friend of his youth not at all as i or any humanized perception at the crafts settlement would see her , but quite as she sees herself , as a fascinating , gifted , capricious woman of the world , beating the wings of her thwarted love of beauty against cruel circumstance . i noticed his attitude as soon as i mentioned to him that lorraine had by chance discovered that he and my aunt were old acquaintances . he said that he would be very much interested in seeing her again . as he happened at the moment to be looking over a packet of postals announcing his series of talks on ' script , ' he asked me her address , called his stenographer , and had it added to his mailing-list . but before the postal reached her she had called him up to tell him she had lately heard of his work and of him for the first time after all these years , through lorraine , and to ask him to come to see her . his call , i am sure , they spent in a rich mutual misunderstanding as thoroughly satisfactory to both as any one could wish . for , as i say , on my last visit in the crafts neighborhood she was taking tea with all of them and dr . denbigh . my work dropped out of my hands .
0	pity ! men never have pity for women : they worship or despise them ; they place us on an altar or cast us in the dust to be trodden under foot . we must take care , dear leontine , to build the altar on which they place us so high , that their arms cannot reach us to cast us down .
0	forward , lads ! forward ! " now , lads ! -- now for scotland and our queen " ! she exclaimed , and as she spoke , the sword in her hand pierced the body of the sentinel . at the same instant every man cast his burden to the ground , a hundred hidden swords were revealed , and every sentinel was overpowered .
0	well , what did he mean , anyway ? bertram seemed to be considering this .
0	as they say over the creek , light and look at your saddle ! one rainy afternoon the major and old gid were sitting on a tool-box under the barn shed , when father brennon came riding down the road .
0	all right , " the simplest way , " said freckleton , " is to vote again for the two . what do you say , gentlemen of the den " ?
0	is that the best opinion you have of us , after the way you have been praising us athletes for two years ? " you would be killed , " remonstrated the big german .
0	he was almost admitting that the girls in this country are as pretty as those they raise in the one he came from . hetty decided that she had gone sufficiently far , and turned in her saddle . " what is the englishman telling you , flo " ? she asked .
0	why -- why did not you lick that young devil beetle before he began jawing ? and the sixth in carson 's study sat aghast , glowering at tulke , who was on the edge of tears . " well , " said the head-prefect acidly . " you have made a pretty average ghastly mess of it , tulke " .
0	there 's a pal of yours come to see you , bones , bones was drilling recruits at headquarters when hamilton hailed him from the edge of the square .
0	yes . i found it in his cap and gave it back to him without reading it on his promise to stay in the game . i suppose the kid 's sweet on some girl and was more afraid of being embarrassed than he was of being hurt ! " a piece of paper " ?
0	discharge her ! it was the new cook , it appeared , who had purchased a few pie-pans on her own initiative .
0	i will give you another five minutes , and if you do not do as i tell you we shall open fire on you .
0	i ' m sure he would appreciate your confidence , " smart feller , " commended smith . " if i had to have my leg took off i ' d just as lief have that man do it as any doctor i ever saw " .
0	hurrah ! mr . dodge is found . dick prescott and dave darrin found him ! bert dodge stopped right there . bayliss , too , started and turned . around the nearest corner some folks were making a big noise . then around the corner came two autos , while a crowd raced along on the sidewalks .
0	then white fang , to show his friendship , will have to be chief mourner at the funeral , " take collie inside and leave the two of them to fight it out , " suggested scott 's father . " after that they will be friends " .
0	not with our snap around ! " i do not know , " answered bert . " he was a strange one . but he did not stay long " !
0	charles holland ! oh ! release me ! varney ! varney ! why do you not come to save me ? i have toiled for you most unrequitedly -- i have not had my reward . let it all consist in my release from this dreadful bondage . help ! help ! oh , help !
0	it must be so , then , for you have spoke the english more better as nice .
0	here ? what should he find here ?
0	i do not think i shall be much of a fighter , and why is it any worse to go among the boys and girls in the factory than among the boys and girls in school ? you never minded that .
0	i was mad , mad . i loved you so wildly , anthony , that i was stunned . and , in spite of it all , i loved you just as much . and that made me so furious , i could have torn my hair . i wanted to hurt you cruelly , and when i did , i bruised my own heart .
0	watch out ! drive your beast on !
0	monody ! he seemed mightily surprised , but he went on : " well , the girl was a beauty , an ' she had a gigantic maid -- "
0	yes , mr gentlemen , yes , i do -- and --
0	i do not believe they would , " i do not see how you can pronounce those words , " added laybold . " they would choke me to death " .
0	home run ! " hit it out " ! yelled a hundred in unison .
0	there 's no reason to be afraid , mr . jellybrand . . he 's such a little dog . kindest woman in the world , she had seen with a strange un-christian pleasure the dog 's advance upon the black trousers . then mr . jellybrand had been obviously afraid . he fancied , perhaps , that she too had been afraid . he fancied , perhaps , that she was not mistress in her house , that she could be browbeaten by her sister and her nurse .
0	aha ! they soon learn the difference ' twixt the young ' un and the old ' un . go along , luce ! and learn yer lessons for to-morrow .
0	let the prince beware , we can not both live in the same cloud , you know . i will push him off .
0	mine , oh ! it is large . it is to reign like that star . it is to labour forward from age to age at the great tasks that god shall set me ; to return and bow before his throne crying , ' it is done . behold , is the work good ? ' for the hour that they endure it is still to be with those whom i have loved on earth , although they cannot see me ; to soothe their sorrows , to support their weakness , to lull their fears . it is that the empty longing and daily prayer may be filled , and filled , and filled again , like a cup from a stream which never ceases . " what is your picture , miss fregelius ? tell me , if you will " .
0	what a coward ! and he confessed it publicly ?
0	sure ! but it pays us too . they keep other bums away . i talk to them sometimes . " somebody pays them to come , " he grumbled , helping her into a pale blue kimono .
0	it will take but an instant , see ! i will show you that the contents are intact !
0	oh , what is it ? a loud report , and then another , brought them back rudely from a make-believe wood near athens to a peril-haunted park in an english county . for the second time that night sylvia knew what fear meant . intuitively , she shrank close to the strong man who seemed destined to be her protector ; and when an arm clasped her again , she cowered close to its sheltering embrace .
0	you need not worry about mordon , mordon and i are going to be married .
0	i ' m sure i sha not object , in the least , if we walk directly to the spot , and hit the box on the third dig of the pick ! but let us forget the old pirate , until to-morrow ; tell me about northumberland -- it seems a year since i left ! when one goes away for good and all , it 's different , you know , from going away for the summer .
0	merciful heavens ! hakkabut pointed out that the weight was duly registered on every packet , and that the packets had never been unfastened . the captain , however , had his own special object in view , and would not be diverted . the jew fetched his steelyard , and a packet of the tobacco was suspended to it .
0	but not better than mine , come , do encourage me , and say that you are glad to see me .
0	what shall we do ? now he will kill the little beaver ! then the captain called to him , but he bounded from the rock and managed to force his way through the bushes , the leash catching here and there on stumps , on sharp rocks , or on bushes .
0	haul in all lines ! rolfe , hustle up all the spare junk and sand . lads , keep under cover until i call you out .
0	few ! by crums , the streets are blocked with them . you could not fall out of a window in this town without killing a doctor . but of all the -- well , there , you will see them for yourself . you walked to my house at avonmouth , munro . i do not let my friends walk to my house at bradfield -- eh , what ?

0	a lion hunt ! " oho , hickory " ! called strongarm , " what is it " ?
0	oh , well , from reports i reckon mrs . cyril does not play either a banjo or a guitar , alice says she wears rubber heels on her shoes , and has put hushers on all the chair-legs , and felt-mats between all the plates and saucers . anyhow , cyril is building a new house , and he looks as if he were in a pretty healthy condition , as you will see to-morrow night .

" i was chosen , " replied eugene , breathing hard and growing pale , " because i love the marchioness " .
0	no , i ' m just sorry i grieved mother . when they had finally got the atmosphere cleared a bit , he inquired , still smiling : " well , are you sorry now you went to the captain 's " ?
0	maybe so , but it 's a possibility -- and possibilities have to be dealt with . " that 's going far afield , is not it " ?
0	she 's coming ! they had an ax with them , and tom cut down the tree and trimmed it . then , resting the log on one stone , they inserted the end under the big rock and pressed down with all their might .
0	and so did the poor devil whom mercier sewed up , " no matter , he loved her , " returned the englishman , straightening in his seat and squaring his broad shoulders .
0	you two do not need to be announced , go right in .
0	that 's a fool question ! the less he 's played at the track the better . we will unload in the pool rooms on the coast , same as we did before . wilson here can enter blitzen in the same race , and they can not get away from making blitzen the favourite : on form they ' d have to pick him to win easy . i will let it leak out that i ' m only sending zanzibar for a workout and to see whether he 's improved any over last season . the pool rooms will not know what hit ' em . " where do we bet this money " ? demanded porter .
0	but my ten caldor make me and my goods acceptable ? " i think the priests like having a few penitents around to explain things to newcomers , and to furnish examples of the power of kondaro " .
0	i do . do you remember the legend that all races have , the myth of the buried treasure , and the dragon , the serpent that watches it , guards it , keeping everyone away ?
0	sure . i ' m living at my own risk , doctor . but i ' d a heap rather be alive than daid , and take all the risk that 's coming , too . but since you make a point of it , i will do most of my walking on a bronco 's back .
0	a rope ! " it 's harris " ! exclaimed diamond . " he is down there , and his time has come at last " !
0	you can say what you want about robbers and bandits and -- and all things like that being bad -- in the movies -- but anyway , i do not care how many censors there are -- you have got to admit that the movies are all right -- they can -- what d ' ye call it -- they can reveal identities , they can -- all the passengers were laughing . even the conductor and the detectives were laughing . i was laughing so hard , i could not speak .
0	here goes ! close beside her , out of the wave , uprose a yellow hand , grasping -- seeking -- clutching . it fastened itself into the meshes of her floating hair .
0	now then ! make haste ! by dawn the next morning orso was up and ready to start . his style of dress betrayed the desire for smartness felt by every man bound for the presence of the lady he would fain please , combined with the caution of a corsican _in vendetta_ . over a blue coat , that sat closely to his figure , he wore a small tin case full of cartridges , slung across his shoulder by a green silk cord . his dagger lay in his side pocket , and in his hand he carried his handsome manton , ready loaded . while he was hastily swallowing the cup of coffee colomba had poured out for him , one of the herdsmen went out to put the bridle and saddle on the black horse . orso and his sister followed close on his heels and entered the field . the man had caught the horse , but he had dropped both saddle and bridle , and seemed quite paralyzed with horror , while the horse , remembering the wound it had received during the night , and trembling for its other ear , was rearing , kicking , and neighing like twenty fiends .
0	enough of that ! i will do the talking -- you the reasoning . i have a proposition to make to you , and if you know what 's best , you will agree . otherwise you will be first of the terrestrials to die . is that clear ?
0	that is true enough , but you must remember that critics do not buy either books or paintings , and that there are plenty of people who buy the idiotic books and are perfectly content with pictures without a particle of artistic merit .
0	in that event , it is granted before you ask . what is it i can do ? " senator " ! said macloud , a little later , when they had finished luncheon . " i want to ask a slight favor -- not political however -- so it will not have to be endorsed by the organization " .
0	put your helm hard down and bring her to the wind ! as the dense smoke was swept away forward on the wind , they could see the _revenge_ , her rigging still further damaged by the volley , going about on the starboard tack , and making straight for the shore .
0	tom 's just on the point of telling us what really happened to him last night , " what 's the matter " ? inquired dick , halting .
0	i will see what i can do for you . the children 's mama was sitting in the library reading when the old cat came in , with a kitten in her mouth . she put it softly down , went out , and soon returned with another . she kept on doing this until she had moved all her family of five kittens . then she settled herself in a cozy corner , and looked at the lady , and purred in this way : " if you only knew how much trouble i have had with that bad old hen , you would let me and my children stay here " .
0	frontenac railed at my impertinence also . " of the first journey there is nothing more to tell , save that the english governor said you were as brave a gentleman as ever played ambassador -- which was , you remember , much in count frontenac 's vein " .
0	do not believe him , doctor ! if you know him , you will understand that to offer all he had was like him , when he saw my necessity . you will come to see us soon ?
0	oh , but this mescal is something quite different . the mexican drink mescal is made from the maguey-plant and is a frightfully horrid thing that sends the peon out of his senses and makes him violent . mescal as i mean it is a little shrub , a god , a cult , a religion .
0	oh , yes , it will ! there 's no telling what it can buy in jonah 's junk shop , i got a rusted tea tray that polished into silver plate , a blackened vase that rubbed into burnished copper . i should not wonder if he had an aladdin 's lamp hidden somewhere in his dusty shelves .
0	all right -- up to the control room , everybody ! fast ! he found the steel collision-mat in place , and the welding of it nearly completed . a few feathery trickles of water still seeped through on each side , but under his terse directions the pumps were soon draining it out . the weird figures of the crew in their sea-suits looked like creatures from another planet as they rapidly finished the job .
0	do not worry , i will be here .
0	raise it one , " drop all the bars but the middle one " . hartigan did so , leaving only the three-foot bar of the pasture . lou-jane circled off and cleared it without an effort .
0	a girl -- i see ! well , i will get through by nine o ' clock . you can give me the three hours till then ? it 's a matter of importance , and i want your advice .
0	you can not do that , this way , gents .
0	third down ! six to go ! the claflin full-back faked a kick and circled around lee 's end for a six-yard gain . then the blue 's right half plugged the line and got three more past hall . it was one to go on third down . another attack on hall was pushed back , but claflin made it first down by sending cox squirming around thayer . the ball was on the eleven yards now . it was brimfield 's turn to know the fear of defeat . edwards implored and bullied . claflin banged at gilbert for a yard . a quarter-back run caught steve edwards napping and put the pigskin on the seven yards . brimfield 's adherents , massed along the side line , shouted defiantly . across the darkening , trampled field , the claflin cohorts were imploring a touchdown .
0	no ! not till we get our house done . will it be of adobe , alessandro ?
0	he has eyes like the christ , he will be wise and good , my wondering little child . god grant him strength to do whate ' er his tasks may be , but spare him , if thou wilt , o , spare him calvary !
0	you dare ? let us not come to blows !
0	i can not go to sleep , billie , i can not . do not leave me alone any more .
0	i might have known it ! he is always doing such things . but where is he ? is he hurt ?
0	my having more money will not make trouble between me and bob ; he does not mind how much i have got . but i suppose you want steve back ? " i do not know , " helen answered dejectedly . " he hinted that he might not come until spring ; i think he means to stop until he has earned enough to make him independent . that 's partly my fault -- i said something rash . if i had not had more money than him , it would not have happened " .
0	not anywhere in the garden , but there 's no doubt plenty in the asparagus-bed , which is the usual place for it .
0	you mistake me for somebody else . i have no sister . this is the old brown place -- a very , very old house . it belonged to my great grandmother . if you are interested i will be glad to show you the interior . i brought the key with me . " is -- is it _yours_ " ? he managed to say , " or -- or your sister 's " ?
0	take that away ! jeffreys flushed scarlet as he read this elegant effusion , and , greatly to walker 's astonishment crushed the letter up into a ball and flung it out of the window .
0	as you yourself said once , i ' m ' not men end_sentence_quote but it is not done , little girl . take my word for that , please . " i go to your house whenever i like " !
0	oh , willingly ! " he acted under pressure of necessity , " replied ameni . " and a man so favored by the gods as he , is not to be lightly given up because an untimely impulse of generosity prompted him to rash conduct . i know -- i can see that you wish him ill . promise me , as you value me as an ally , that you will not attempt his life " .
0	i can not live any way but the way i have been used to all my life , " if you want to keep that house and live comfortably , " he went on , " you have got to cut expenses to the bone . you see that , do not you " ?
0	that 's not kelly 's voice , what deviltry 's going on here ?
0	i wants pie ! " oh , i want to eat all right " ! shouted tom and ted and janet and lola , all at one time .
0	not quite that , though i am not exactly what you might call poor .
0	why , would you dare tackle a grizzly ? " if only they were in there now " ! said john .
0	stop the boat ! back her !
0	this has small cloven feet , but there are only two legs , also ! now and then you can see where one track looks as if a hind foot had broken in on another one ! that was enough ! in another moment every scout was bounding down the trail in order to reach the spot first and win honor by knowing the track correctly .
0	then your men are not so clever as ours , for they manage many little affairs their own women never suspect .
0	both our men have the same name . i like your man so much , if i may say so . he is worth a great deal . we can not expect big things to come to us in a small , mediocre way , can we ?
0	oh , dear me ! we might just as well be drowned as be like this . we _are_ drowned from our waists down .
0	that pig you gave me for a hostage played a trick ! he and a man of mine knew persian . they talked together . then in the night they ran away , and your hostage went to wassmuss , and has told him all the truth and more untruth into the bargain than ten other men could invent in a year ! so wassmuss threw in my teeth that letter you gave me , and i was laughed out of countenance by a heritage of spawn of tophet ! and what has wasmuss done but persuade three hundred kurds of a tribe who are my enemies to accept this duty of escort at a great price ! and so your germans are gone into persia already ! now give me the gold and my hostages back , and i will leave you to your own devices !
0	you are too kind , richard , always thinking of my pleasure . a ride like this once a week is tonic enough . he turned to alice westmore : " you have only to tell me which days -- if i am too busy to go with you -- jim will bring her over " .
0	ha , ha ! " girls are nuts , " jerry said .
0	you will say it quickly , and here , or not at all , " pardon me , but i think , in this matter , you would have objection " .
0	what in the world are you two boys up to now ? do you call that dropping corn ? hurry and catch up with the team ; you are ' way behind .
0	shut that door ! you will let them in on me , and they bite ! they ' re poison ! they will kill me !
0	perdition catch such an age ! an age of dogs , an age barren of reverence for superiors and respect for authority ! the pillory --
0	from out of the mouths of children , well , you know the rest ! i have an idea that you have solved the problem .
0	no , indeed ! this is not anything , nor the first upset i have been in -- reggie tipped us over once .
0	if i wrote a check right this minute , to pay for a postage stamp , it would go to protest , i guess i can stand it to be broke for a week though .
0	i thought that was where he would be ! there followed a street map covering some fifteen square blocks , and a bright red dot was imprinted in the center of the map .
0	i expect it 's something of that sort , alice , " as he has only asked for you , and no one else , i suppose he does . at any rate i have no lively curiosity as to his visit , and i do not suppose harry has either . most likely it 's some man who wants to sell you jewellery or cameos , or to ask you for a subscription for the chaplain , or to beg of you on some pretext or other ; they are always at it . he saw your name on the hotel list standing without any male protector of the same name . no doubt he thinks you are an elderly spinster with money " .
0	i could not tell her , as somebody expressed it , that actresses happen in the best of families , but i left her to decide whether she cared to have them happen in her m nage . " yes , " said the lady , who as usual did not mean it . " it is too bad . margaret , the dear child , is so inexperienced that i feel that i must blame myself . i have kept from her -- how shall i put it ? well , everything , and when she learned about this , i could not tell her that it was all very usual . it would have offended her modesty too much " .
0	no , nothing , " was there something else " ? she asked , setting her silver carefully atop her empty plate .
0	i ' m dying to talk with her . she 's far and away the most interesting of our newly rich , and i like her face . frank has called , you know ? " but what can you expect of a girl brought up in a pigsty . her mother was mistress of a little miners ' hotel in junction city , allen says , and the girl boasts of it " .
0	under that guise he poses unsuspected by the police , you can rest assured that i have made every inquiry and that now i know .
0	not clipped , captain -- but shorn of his locks like samson , " you have just had him clipped , i see , " ventured mrs . vernon .
0	oh , yes ! i can make them out distinctly . of course , i know pretty well what they are , but in any case i could easily describe them to you if i ' d never seen them before .
0	it goes into sheep ultimately , now , what i am trying to get at is this : i ' m in debt to you a heap , miss messiter , and since i ' m not all yellow cur , i intend to play fair with you . i have ordered my sheep back across the deadline . you can have this range to yourself for your cattle . the fight 's off so far as we personally are concerned .
0	i never get angry in moments like these . i am giving you a sword to ease my conscience . i do not assassinate boys . " what promise have i , " said maurice , " that you will not run me through when i stoop for the sword " ? this question did not serve .
0	where are you girls ? " cuckoo " ! rang out linda 's voice from the bank .
0	i ' m always broke , sweetheart . i ' m an unfortunate cuss , am i not ? those claims of mine did not yield wages and i was forced to sell my outfit at danby to get railroad fare back to san pasqual . and if the train had not been ten minutes late -- if i had not gone into the eating-house looking for you -- i would , have arrived in time to have saved poor hennage . it was my fight , after all , and poor harley was not used to firearms . " donna , " said bob mcgraw , when dan pennycook had departed , after delivering the letter from the state land office , " the applications of my clients are approved and ready to be passed to patent . i have been called upon to pay the balance of thirty-nine thousand dollars due on the land , and if there are thirty-nine cents real money in this world , i do act possess them . will you loan me a hundred dollars , dear , from that thousand harley p . gave you ? i must go to san francisco on business " .

0	oh , sam ! riding over the flat top mountains would be the hardest work for me , these days ! " maw , you can go , too . you agreed to take things easy , you know , " reminded her husband .
0	you look like it . as it happened , i saw miss waynefleet crossing the clearing . it occurs to me that she may have said something that set you thinking .
0	you are indeed inexperienced if you think that hiang-nu is beautiful . your wish is easily fulfilled . said kung : " i am grateful to you for your friendly thought . but if the girl you have in mind is not just as beautiful as hiang-nu , then i would rather do without " .
0	i ' m afraid he 's fresh in the morning , " oh , he 's an old woman , " said hall , laughing ; " he 's always wanting to tell you this and that , as if no one knew anything about sailing but himself " . and he took off his hat and waved it ceremoniously to the old sailor , who continued shouting and beckoning all the while , though without avail , for the only words that came to us across the water were " fresh " and " afternoon , " and we were not much enlightened by them .
0	do you know what you ' re about ? i will have the law on you this very day .
0	why not ? what d ' you think i came ' way off here for ? just to sit around and suck my thumb ? huh ! i guess i can do as much toward finding uncle brocky as ever you will , janice day .
0	keep her on ! -- keep her on ! you son of a _maudite m re_ ! child of the accursed ! we must run into skull haven ! and if the men of skull take so much as an iron bolt from us , and i misdoubt them , i will keel-haul you , son of the _diable_ ! i will not leave an inch of skin upon you !
0	why will not i ? " no , do not , " said daniel , turning pale with terror . " if you go in to see the director you will never come with me " .
0	why do you keep on working after you have thrown it ? you can not help it along then . " there it goes again ! not nearly so far as yours . what is the matter with me ? give me another " . she faced the cliff and whirled again . the stone spun out , not quite so far as before .
0	he was in a hurry to get back to the soft side of military life at manila , well , before you investigate the hut it may be well for me to give you some idea as to the situation . what i have to say may give direction to your search of the place .
0	are ye ashamed o ' yer name , ye young english upstart ? mcallister glared at him with wild bloodshot eyes ; under other circumstances he would have been ashamed of the part he was playing ; but now his nerves were raw and his temper was rendered wild by his craving .
0	permission granted , " hal , " proposed noll , " i want to ask you something " .
0	bravo ! i suppose they had ladies ' -maids to lace you by the capstan . well , they were jolly fellows !
0	yes , there is . i wish you ' d sit down a while and talk to me unless your errand --
0	and yet he does not know everything , he may have stabbed me in the back , but he is quite ignorant as to what advice i gave to enid henson , which brings me back to the cigar-case . you saw me looking at it in lockhart 's . go on .
0	buy drinks with your money ! the race was to be for a finish , not a dead heat . we will try it again , sometime .
0	not more than i deserved , i will be bound . how can you be so absurd ! if anyone wants forgiveness , it is i . i say , armie , this is all nonsense . you do not really think you are done for , or you would not take it so coolly . " indeed i want you to forgive me , jock . you do not know how often i have thought all sorts of horridness about you " .
0	all hands cut away wreckage ! we ' re all right . she will not dare come any nearer . hurrah !
0	oh , not one person in ten million ever wants me to sing , barbara 's face was in shadow , but eric could see that she was looking across the room at him .
0	that is because you never sailed the seas and had to call on one for aid , if you did you would be very thankful , i guess , that the government has so carefully provided some one to answer just the sort of question you wished answered . i try to remember this when i get hot under the collar because the license for our station does not arrive . uncle sam can not help it if his men are slow . the plan at the top is all right . there must be rules to govern wireless stations , be they governmental , commercial , or private ; rules to regulate the wave lengths each may use ; rules to make sure the operators who have charge of them know their job ; and inspectors to make sure that every such rule is obeyed .
0	ugh ! " are you there " ? rumbled the cowardly lion anxiously . a great clod of earth landed on his head , filling his eyes and mouth with mud .
0	dream on , zeus , for the dream shall soon end . as for you , blunt your arrows if you will . in a moment i shall feed you to cerberus . quickly demo notched an arrow .
0	i guess vi is afraid you will not have enough , " i do " ! cried vi . " where do you keep your things to eat , grandma ? have you got a big pantry " ?
0	oh , charley ! come on and get a square meal , anyway .
0	bravo ! " good for him " ! exclaimed one .
0	yes you will -- not , if i know anything about you , you will not do anything that would give miss benham to trevison .
0	hurrah ! " ' tention " ! said the captain ; and , to use the old saying , the dropping of a pin could have been heard . " this gentleman , sir john meadows , bart . , is going to buy the _silver star_ " .
0	some fun in him i know , and what nice manners he has , and black eyes , i wonder if he appreciates them ?
0	my name 's nasmyth , and in a moment he had accosted the man by the boy 's nickname , obviously without thinking of an affront which few would have read in that hearty open face and hand .
0	oh , yes ! provoked to imprudence by this sudden contrariety , this strange inconsistence , he made a futile attempt to regain her hand . " do not be foolish . ca not you see i ' m crazy about you " ?
0	good morning , little stranger , you ' re pretty far from home . wo not you get your feet wet ? the ocean 's pretty dewy this morning . well , what do _you_ want ? shoot it , and shoot fast . peter moore 's at the key , and the faster you shoot them the better peter likes them .
0	cicero 's orations . " they want dash and fire there , " he said , " and these qualities must be united with good common sense . in addressing the house , you see , thelma , one must rouse and interest the men -- not bore them . you can not expect fellows to pass a bill if you have made them long for their beds all the time you have been talking about it " .
0	shall that be a rule ? " it 's more fun to make things up , " answered cricket , from the depths of her experience . " but we can write about that old red hen , and about poor little wallops " -- referring to a little black cat , lately deceased . " then each of you must send me in some things besides your stories , and i will make some up myself . let 's appoint next tuesday for a meeting , if i can get the paper done . if i do not , we will have it as soon as i can get it ready " .
0	well , i wish i had that kind of story book for you , but i have not ! " oh , i wanted a story book , " explained the little girl , as she sat up . " we have story books in our library , an ' there ought to be story books here . i looked in this room an ' i saw a lot of books , so i did ask for one with a story in it . i like a story about pigs an ' bears an ' -- an ' everything " ! finished flossie .
0	no ; ben 's is nearest . ben 's beat ! hooray ! " a tie ! a tie " ! cried the girls , as a general rush took place toward the target .
0	yes -- my dark messenger , she said fiercely : " i wish it were over . life is cruel . i suppose we must move on . will you come , please " ?
0	no ! the judge is all right . i just met him walking over the bridge after the freight had gone through . it was not twenty minutes ago . but you can not save a thing -- not a stick of furniture . the whole thing is gone from front to back on the ground floor already !
0	i ? i did not drop -- i climbed -- up the steps from the landing , i was out on the bay in my canoe -- we came up yesterday in the yacht -- and i heard that beautiful indian call , and i just _had_ to find out where it came from , and what it meant . i suspected a girls ' camp , but of course i never dreamed of finding you here . do tell me all about it . it is a camp , is not it ?
0	murdock , simpson , just hoist that swab oahika up on his feet and take him to the rail , so that those fellows in the canoe may see him .
0	well , your prettiness is a part of you -- an appropriate part , i think , but only a part after all . you see i am not afraid of spoiling you . you are strangely like your father ; in the shape of your face , the colour of your eyes , and in your voice you are like him . " thank you , mr . travers ; but you , perhaps , think all that because i am -- because you think i am pretty " .
0	but he can not follow the fashions in eyes , oh , this is atrocious of us -- it is simply horrible to sit here and say such things . i am cold-blooded enough as it is -- material enough , mean , covetous , contemptible --
0	you cannot spoil sport with the priests , if they were egyptians , then indeed ! they are not to be taken in their nests without getting pecked ; but here , as i have said , we have to deal with greeks . what have you to fear from them ? for aught i care you may leave our hebe where she is , but i was once much pleased with these representations , and to-morrow morning , as soon as i have slept , i shall return to alexandria , if you do not carry them into effect , and so deprive me , heracles , of the bride chosen for me by the gods . i have said what i have said , and i am not given to changing my mind . besides , it is time that we should show ourselves to our friends feasting here in the next room . they are already merry , and it must be getting late .
0	if they work into the corral , some of you help me put up the fence again and we will have them !
0	jacob wassyl wants none of you here , " of course , " cried a number of friendly voices . " and why not ? that is quite right " .
0	found the shed door open , and surprised the camp by a flank movement . you would not do for picket duty , boys , " how did he get in himself " ? asked gwen , glad to turn the conversation .
0	i know ! but what ' d he say ? what 's the upshot ?
0	quick ! they will eat us alive !
0	where was i ? ah , yes ! the shipping of the stuff to belgium . you see , brellier 's clever there . he knows that the sudden appearance of all this gold at his own bank would arouse suspicions , especially as the robberies have been so frequent , so he determines that it is safer out of the country , and as the exchange of british gold is high , he makes money that way . turns his hand to everything , in fact . but now we ' re turning our hands to _him_ , and the law will have its toll , penny for penny , life for life . you have come to the end of _your_ resources , brellier , when you engaged those two strange workmen . or , better still , your accomplice did it for you . you did not know they were cleek and his man , did you ? you did not know that on that second night after we ' d worked there at the factory for you , we investigated that secret passage in the field outside saltfleet road ? you did not know that while you walked down that passage in the darkness with your man jim dobbs -- or ' dirty jim , ' to give him the sobriquet by which he is known among your employees -- that we were hidden against the wall opposite to that first little niche where the bags of sovereigns stood , and that -- though i had not seen you -- something in your voice struck a note of familiarity in my memory ? you did not know that , then ? well , perhaps it 's just as well , because i might not be here now to tell this story , and to hand you over to justice .
0	oh , he 's worse than that , fred . it is not polite to mention what he is , outside of the arabian nights . i guessed you ' d come to rub it into me . " bixby 's office , general freight agent of the burlington " . ottenburg began to button his overcoat and drew on his gloves . " i have got to have one shot at you before i go , archie . did not i tell you pinky alden was a cheap squirt " ?
0	but it was not i that -- a-a-ah ! see how he approaches the queen 's screen , to destroy it as he has destroyed her bed .
0	i guessed that , and she keeps her name rider at milburgh 's request . he asked her not to reveal the fact that she was married again . is not that so ?
0	is anything wrong ? shall i come ? " i wonder whether i hit him , " said jack , proceeding to throw out the empty cartridges and reload .
0	sure it is , here is just as much a place as there .
0	he 's had luck -- quite a run o ' luck . he 's been sellin ' picters -- three-four on ' em . andy looked . " he 's poor as poverty . he 's said so -- times enough " .
0	i do not know , the german skull is pretty thick . still you can get something through it once in a while if you keep on hammering .
0	that surprises you ! but i had already traveled through half the empire , and had experienced more than other boys of twice my age . i was , at any rate , still child enough to forget everything else in the brilliant spectacle that unfolded before my eyes . i remember to this day the colored wax statue which represented pertinax so exactly that it might have been himself risen from the grave . and the procession ! it seemed to have no end ; one new thing followed another . all walked past in mourning robes , even the choir of singing boys and men . cilo explained to me who had made the statues of the romans who had served their country , who the artists and scholars were , whose statues and busts were carried by . then came bronze groups of the people of every nation in the empire , in their costumes . cilo told me what they were called , and where they lived ; he then added that one day they would all belong to me ; that i must learn the art of fighting , in case they resisted me , and should require suppressing . also , when they carried the flags of the guilds past , when the horse and foot soldiers , the race-horses from the circus and several other things came by , he continued to explain them . i only remember it now because it made me so happy . the old man spoke to me alone ; he regarded me alone as the future sovereign . he left geta to eat the sweets which his aunts had given him , and when i too wanted some my brother refused to let me have any . then cilo stroked my hair , and said : ' leave him his toys . when you are a man you shall have the whole roman empire for your own , and all the nations i told you of end_sentence_quote geta meanwhile had thought better of it , and pushed some of the sweetmeats toward me . i would not have them , and , when he tried to make me take them , i threw them into the road .
0	oh , no . she personally has nothing to do with it . at least not directly . it was the commotion of blood and -- brain . the air -- the change . i do not know what . " will it deal with her " ?
0	oh , no . but i saw you there , and you seemed to be .
0	what , would you like to pick a husband out among them , dame ? " it is a shame to turn such grand looking men into gladiators , " a woman said .
0	but everybody does not give her a fortune , as nettie 's aunt rachel did , " oh , everybody loves ruth . why should not they " ? cried belle .
0	hold hard ! bob , forgetful of his sprain , lowered himself into her , and grasped the oars , while the captain followed .
0	sure , i did not suppose a human being took notice of it , " i saw you at the station when you came yesterday " .
0	i ' m not afraid of anything _there_ hurting you , in fact , it strikes me that it will do you a great deal of good .
0	quick -- where is she ? you will die like a spiked rat . where ? in deferential silence he saluted the battle grimed newcomer . battered , panting , bleeding , harry lunged at the man , gripped him .
0	oh , i ' m not asking for payment in kind . but there 's such a thing as fair play -- and interest on one 's money -- and hang me if i have had as much as a look from you -- " pay up " ? she faltered . " do you mean that i owe you money " ?
0	you hound ! you have played your cards well , you and your little red-headed scoundrel ! if you think i am a spy you will find --

0	do you insinuate , that he is a captive of mine ?
0	yes , sir ; how he pushed peaks overboard , and then ran away , i do not often wear my uniform on shore , for my wife thinks it attracts too much attention ; so that he did not suspect me of any connection with the fleet .

0	that 's very kind of you , do sit down , mrs . wicks . there 's a nice shady place right here beside me .
0	oh , papa , you ' re too funny ! " well , " he said , laying the package on his knees , " i will see what else there is . i may find a solitary raisin enveloped in a pound or two of paper " .
0	i ' m glad i ' m not a minister 's daughter , poor faith is so furious because she will not dare to dance tonight . una does not care , of course . she has never hankered after dancing . somebody told faith there would be a taffy-pull in the kitchen for those who did not dance and you should have seen the face she made . she and jem will sit out on the rocks most of the evening , i suppose . did you know that we are all to walk down as far as that little creek below the old house of dreams and then sail to the lighthouse ? wo not it just be absolutely divine ?
0	you ' re sure drivin ' her , skipper ! up them halyards go . oh , lord , but she 's a dog , an ' she will stand it .
0	i remember those speeches ! " he was , " agreed the sheriff . " he ran the valley and he ran it right . every fourth of july he made a speech about making lost chief the plymouth rock of the west " .

0	yes , i know . " you see the trouble _was , " _ she said and saw eve 's downcast believing admiring sympathetic face , " fraulein talked to me about manner , she simply wanted me to grimace , _simply._ _you_ know -- be like other people " .
0	eh , i will let thee be , but in good sooth , _nell_ , thou art a right queer body . and if it should please the queen 's highness to wed with _mounseer_ [ note 1 ] , as ' tis thought of many it shall , then thou wilt be out of her company , and i shall be in . what shalt thou do then for company ?
0	that is not like you , monsieur du tillet , you who generally have a good word for everyone . it seems to me that you are hard upon the young man , who appears to be animated by excellent sentiments towards us .
0	who wants to be told such an obvious thing ? anyhow , you have only got to look and you will see how the votes are piling tip . " but who the devil told you i ' m an aristocrat " ? cried paul .
0	begorra ! we have seen him glow ! " he has many other contrivances , " captain bellwood went on . " he has explained that , by means of electricity , he can make his canoe or himself glow with a white light in the darkest night " .

0	go with you , mio padre ! no , no ; i must decline the honor . the hour of settlement has come ! alphonso mazzolin , for long you have plotted my destruction ; and one by one removed every obstacle in your way , and smoothed my path to ruin ! i have known this -- silently i have watched you maneuver . you counseled ma uel ; you flattered him , encouraged his hasty course and overbearing manner , and caused the rupture between us . you knew my nature , and foresaw the result . you thought to secure me within the walls of yonder gloomy convent , and hoped that in time my broad lands would bless and enrich your holy church ! but , padre , i did not fancy the home prepared for me in san jose . i promised to comply with my father 's wish , and fulfil the engagement , much to your surprise and chagrin . padre , i would have married ma uel , sooner than second your plans . i , too , foresaw the tempest that even now howls over us . it was my only hope , and i said , who may predict the chances of war ? the americans may yet number the most here , and then your power will be at an end . seemingly i was passive , but you are thwarted . we stand face to face , and i scorn you , incarnate devil as you are . how dared you do as you have done ? mine eyes are opened -- you can no longer deceive me with your lying legends and the marvelous traditions of your country . i tell you , i hate you with an everlasting hate . you have led me far from god , if there be a god , and may my curse follow you , even to your grave ! " inez , listen ! i leave this place before many days . my work is finished here ; there are none to oppose , and i go elsewhere . to mexico first , and then to italy . you must go with me , my proud beauty ! i cannot leave you here " !

0	well , you heard how the new sheriff did it -- skunked away with his whole posse before one-eighth of my men ! you saw how the rest of this camp held up your nine troopers , and that sap-headed cub of a lieutenant -- did not you ? you would not have been standing here if you had not . no ; there is not the civil process nor the civil power in all california that can take me out of this camp . " said you ' d got to be took anyhow ! they allowed the new sheriff would do it too " .

0	emu , " mine , " said norah , " is a bird " .
0	oh , kakaibod , i ' m a pie-faced old has-been , and nobody will ever love me again !
0	they do not , i stole it ! -- from one of the maids in my apartment . it was the only way i could get here without being seen . i felt i must see you at once . we have got to do something , soon , or it will be too late . i felt that , as a scientist , you might have some idea how we could get off .
0	of course , silly , " of course not , silly , " nesta retorted . " any one can see everything is going to be quite different now aunt dorothy has come " .
0	ca not you get any more speed out of them , val ? it was at the first volley that the alarmed black drivers nearly got out of hand , while the teams began to huddle together and threatened a stampede . the black boys , however , soon saw they had more to fear from us than from the boers ; and by the time our friends had remounted and trotted up to us the wagon-train was steadied again .
0	son-in-law ! that scoundrel -- he 's a bigamist . i got the proofs from germany this morning . " you can not deal with courts as you can with your employees , mr . ganser . there are legal forms to be gone through . of course , if you ' re reconciled to your son-in-law , why -- "

0	linda ! how can you think of such a thing ? you would not dare .
0	what a fate ! " i do not want what you call ' fun , ' eva , " -- she said -- " i want love ! love seems to me the only good thing in life . do you understand ? you ask me why i left my aunt -- it was to escape a loveless marriage , -- a marriage that would be a positive hell to me for which neither wealth nor position could atone . as for ' living good , ' i am not trying that way . i only want to understand myself , and find out my own possibilities and limitations . and if i never do win the love i want , -- if no one ever cares for me at all , then i shall be perfectly content to live and die unmarried " .
0	you are our lord ! who but you ? we will follow , if you will lead !
0	oh , clifford ! no , i do not mind . eustace will soon be home . he 's gone to get something .
0	what is this ? although they did not understand his words they guessed the import of them , and the biggest of the men , a powerful negro , repeated the word kaffir and spat upon him . edgar 's right arm flew out from his shoulder , the blow struck the negro on the nose , and in an instant he was upon his back upon the ground . his comrade stood for a moment stupefied , and then with loud yells ran towards the tents , leaving the negro to pick himself up at his leisure . edgar continued the work of raising and emptying the bucket until the negro returned , followed by the sheik , his wife , and all the inhabitants of the village . by this time the negro who had been knocked down had risen to his feet and was roaring like a bull at the top of his voice , while the blood was streaming from his nose .

0	ganymede , " correct , " smiled the teacher faintly . " and today i shall tell you about ganymede and how he was connected with the other characters we have been studying . ganymede -- repeat the name after me " .
0	you mean to say he will not give you the chance you want . " oh , a defence could easily be made . it would give a fellow a splendid chance . you see the case is the talk of the country , and the question of motive has to figure largely . why , the evidence could be riddled ! to say the least of it , one might get a verdict for manslaughter " .
0	who 's on the beach , i say ? the men were on their feet before he had ceased speaking , archie before the captain 's hand had left the knob of the door .

0	there 's only one course to pursue , stevens , that is to be prepared as best we can for the very worst and meet it in some way yet to be determined . but first we must try to figure out what langdon is going to do -- what it can be that he says he will tell us to-morrow at 12 : 30 if we appear . he must have something very startling up his sleeve if he makes good his assertions . i can not see how --
0	these are not the orders of a soldier ! they are orders for a jailer , a hangman , a scullion -- no soldier who wears the sword of a civilized nation can take such orders . the war is over ; the south is conquered ; i have no country save america . for the honour of the flag , for which i once poured out my blood on the heights of buena vista , i protest against this shame !
0	you might go up to the camp and cheer patsy 's heart by a visit , he is fond of the girls .
0	after meeting the romans twenty times in battle , scopus , the noise of a crowd would no more affect me than the roar of the wind over the treetops . still i want to see it ; and more , i want to see how the people of this new sect face death . british women do not fear to die , and often slay themselves rather than fall into the hands of the romans , knowing well that they will go straight to the happy island and have no more trouble . are these christians as brave ? " i am going myself , beric , and will take you with me . i shall start two hours before daybreak , so as to be there in good time . as their lanista i shall enter the arena with them . i cannot take you there , but i know all the attendants , and can arrange for you to be down at the level of the arena . it may not be long before you have to play your part there , and i should like you to get accustomed to the scene , the wall of faces and the roar of applause , for these things are apt to shake the nerves of one unaccustomed to them " .
0	you better make for shore ! the coolie plunged into the water with a weltering splash which sent a small spiral of spray almost to the deck . for a moment the man in the water pedaled and flailed , vastly frightened , and gasping , above the clang of the engine-room telegraph , for a rope . the black side of the _persian gulf_ started to slide away from him .
0	sylvie , sylvie ! can you not be serious ? what do you mean ?
0	you do try so hard to get rid of me , tommy , but it is no use . i am going with you -- do not argue -- and i will help you with the attack . three will work faster than two -- and i am going .

0	do you know who i am ? he curtly beckoned to the plainclothes man , still idling against the building a hundred feet or so up the street . the other approached him , touched the brim of his hat in a half salute .
0	i see that it is not the other world that 's got hold of you ! it 's _this_ world ! i do not believe you will be unhappy in italy . but it 's pleasant to think you have been so contented on the aroostook that you hate to leave it . i do not believe there 's a man on the ship that would not feel personally flattered to know that you liked being here . even that poor fellow who parted from us at messina was anxious that you should think as kindly of him as you could . he knew that he had behaved in a way to shock you , and he was very sorry . he left a message with me for you . he thought you would like to know that he was ashamed of himself . " no , " she answered . " all that seems over forever . i could not go back there and be what i was . i could have stayed there , but i could not go back " .
0	not one ! since i came into my money , i have not drawn half a dozen cheques -- except in the cheque-book i got at smith 's , after mr . shuyler and mr . carleton advised me to keep my winnings there .
0	there 's father , and mother too ! a great crowd gathered by the dock .
0	but with the other work which i have commenced , you are not quite satisfied . you are such an enthusiastic german , that you presume to assert that the intolerable german jargon is a beautiful and expressive language ! " i shall be most happy to be the instrument to make known this generous expression of your majesty 's good-will , " remarked herzberg , bowing .
0	to whom have you left me , my darling ? how shall i live now without you , wretched creature that i am . pity me , good people , pity me , fatherless and motherless , all alone in the world !
0	why , of course . barode barouche -- yes , he 's a great one : he can think , he can write , and he can talk ; and the talking 's the best that he does -- though i have not heard him speak , but i have read his speeches . " have not frenchmen genius " ? asked the girl .
0	a good idea , and i will do everything i can to help out , " there 's a call for you , paul , from some of the fellows in the rear , " observed jack , just then . " i think they want to snap off a view of old rattlesnake , with the troop stretched out along the road here . the sun is dropping lower all the while , and if we ' re going to get a picture we will all want to keep , it ought to be right now " .
0	have you found any thing there , pelham ? i looked up at the speaker -- our eyes met -- i grasped his hand vehemently . he understood me . " put it up , " said he ; " we will keep the secret " . all this , so long in the recital , passed in the rapidity of a moment .
0	drive them in ! what had been a drive became a flight . and it was well so long as the sheep headed straight up the trail . piute had to go to the right to avoid being run down . mescal rode up to fill his place . hare took his cue from dave , and rode along the flank , crowding the sheep inward . august cracked his whip behind . for half a mile the flock kept to the trail , then , as if by common consent , they sheered off to the right . with this move august and dave were transformed from quiet almost to frenzy . they galloped to the fore , and into the very faces of the turning sheep , and drove them back . then the rear-guard of the flock curved outward .
0	the paid agents of beaumont ! sent to disturb our meeting ! englishmen ! will you submit to this ? the nation shall hear --

0	the prussian officer ! the german did not reply .
0	how so ? " but you have not been quite square to us , " said orde . " you are not giving us much show to get our logs out " .
0	well , at that she will not set the thames afire ! " you can not help it , " barbara said . " she 's just as lovely in a holland pinny , or a nightie , or a bathing suit ! i declare she was too lovely on the sands last year , with her straw-coloured hair , and a straw-coloured hat , and her pink cheeks matching a pink apron ! she 's going to be prettier than you are , ju " !
0	a woman wants a man to think of naught but her , " she would not be pleased to think so " .

0	how funny you are ! now i ' m of rather a gloomy temperament . did , you know it ? " i would not have come . it 's bad luck to turn back " .
0	why , then , the clumsy thing will work for once ! i will try to be a good captain . -- the clock is striking . i do not know when nor how i shall see greenwood again . judith , you will wish me well ? " i think that you will make a good captain " .
0	i believe it , the great frederick would announce triumphantly that he had had the great semiramis of the north taken , which the russian police had failed to accomplish . it would be a welcome triumph for unbelievers and fools , and they would trumpet it joyfully through the world ! it must not be ; although my spirit in its power and might would soon release my body , yet i will not grant this momentary triumph to my enemies . my time is limited ; i must forth to egypt , where the brothers of the millennium will assemble in the course of a week in the pyramids , to announce to me their will for the coming century . i am the spirit of god , which the invisibles have willed to enter a human form , therefore it must be regarded as sacred and protected .
0	what ! wo not i ?
0	good luck ! the kid nodded . " adios ! yuh will probably get through to the s bar in good time . good-by , harry " .
0	what good are offerings and little kerosene lamps and dry grain , if squatting in the mud is all that thou canst do ? thou hast dealt long with the gods when they were contented and well-wishing . now they are angry . speak to them !

0	get up ! allen stood by the bedside of the sleeping commandant .
0	i have to do that already , but i do not mind . i can , and that is the main thing . besides , when you really want anything very much , you have a way of forcing me to want it , too , my master-lover !
0	but not thy body 's breadth , bowyer , else may you be overwide .
0	i think i should recognize her on sight , " of course she 's dark , with eyebrows an inch wide . you can not expect me to give an imitation of anything like that , " apologized elfreda .
0	and emil and lilienthal , even timmins , know nothing . it has been a great stroke of nigger luck . this fortune is safe . now for the last touch . " and they will surely keep the secret of 192 layte street , for they wish to run their own ' joint ' there . all they want is silence , to change it a little , and no police interference . they are bound to play my game to save themselves from police interference " .
0	i ' m going to break with her . i do not care for her -- that ! i told her i cared because she provoked me to . it happened because she wanted it to and led up to it .
0	say , is this a trial or a sermon ?
0	ca not see any sign of conyers , i ' m waiting for the pinnace . come up here . there 's such a ripping view .
0	but , father , you would have given the old spit for a pasty and a draught of wine , " hiram , the curiosity-dealer , met me just outside , with the sword that belonged to antony ; and you sold it to him for two thousand drachmae ! you little fool " !
0	why -- just because i was a tinker , " if you are the tinker -- and i presume you are -- i should very much appreciate an explanation . would you mind telling me how you happened to be hanging onto that stump , in rags , and looking half-witted when i -- when i came by " ?
0	you used to talk about our boltin ' -- _once_ " look here , nell , " said haughton , drawing her away into the shadow of the forge , " i ' m a cur , as you say ; but i ' d be a worse cur to keep on this way . you can not marry me , can you " ?
0	cold ! i guess you ' re getting scared all right .
0	and i tell you , do not you dahe to do it ! " i know who has taken it , " repeated rostov in an unsteady voice , and went to the door .
0	let him go ! " come here " ! he said , and , clearing the platform in a spring , he brought his prisoner in a heap with him . " get up " ! he roared at him , jerking him to his feet as if he had been a child .
0	there was not no other way , terry began to sob .
0	and the fine phrases and well turned periods contained in the remarks bestowed upon your unsophisticated country sister , " yes , i think herbie and i are entitled to any amount of gratitude on your part , for the great self-denial we are practicing , and the wonderful exertions we shall put forth in carrying out your wishes and directions in regard to this difficult and irksome business " .

0	_it_ does not exist , do not try circumlocution on me , doc . i ' m not religious . i do not believe that spermatozoa and an ovum , if not allowed to cuddle up together , add up to murder .
0	electric cars and telephones ! oh , i did not say we had not the products , but the thing itself , the precious thing ; that never comes just by wishing , does it ? the art of indifference , the art of choice --
0	oh , no , uncle ! quite the contrary . i did not feel equal to her , " well , i ' m glad it was no worse . i was thinking may be as you despised the old family mare , " said john , somewhat mollified .
0	it 's queer how folks get narrowed down living in a bum layout like the fort . i used to think jos a wise guy one time . there 's heaps of things you can not see right in a layout like that . i reckon jessie ought to know murray better . it 's up to me . do not you guess that way , too ?
0	vexes ? oh , i can not say that . why should it vex me ? after all , warburton is such a thoroughly good fellow , and if he makes money --
0	you drunken fool ! it will be murder ! gross scenes followed in the hall ; the ladies were now upon the stage , and at sight of the desperate criminal they screamed with one accord . in truth i must have given them fair cause , though my mask was now torn away and hid nothing but my left ear . rosenthall answered their shrieks with a roar for silence ; the woman with the bath-sponge hair swore at him shrilly in return ; the place became a babel impossible to describe . i remember wondering how long it would be before the police appeared . purvis and the ladies were for calling them in and giving me in charge without delay . rosenthall would not hear of it . he swore that he would shoot man or woman who left his sight . he had had enough of the police . he was not going to have them coming there to spoil sport ; he was going to deal with me in his own way . with that he dragged me from all other hands , flung me against a door , and sent a bullet crashing through the wood within an inch of my ear .
0	i never did , i hated it so that i used to pick blackberries and sell them to keep myself supplied . my poor old dad thought it a wicked extravagance , but i ' d rather have gone without clothes than shoes .
0	she had been very handsome , but not in winifred 's way . when i knew her she was little and fragile , very pink and white , with a splendid head and a face like fine old lace , somehow , -- but perhaps i always think of that because she wore a lace scarf on her hair . she had such a flavor of life about her . she had known gordon and livingstone and beaconsfield when she was young , -- every one . she was the first woman of that sort i ' d ever known . you know how it is in the west , -- old people are poked out of the way . aunt eleanor fascinated me as few young women have ever done . i used to go up from the works to have tea with her , and sit talking to her for hours . it was very stimulating , for she could not tolerate stupidity . " like her niece " ? wilson queried .
0	and i did not bet a cent ! but i said he was a good horse , remember ?

0	you will be difficult , my dear , if we lose you , to replace !
0	no , you need not fear that i ' m merely humouring you , or think you mad . far from it . your story interests me exceedingly and you furnish me unconsciously with a number of clues as you tell it . you see , i possess some knowledge of my own as to these psychic byways .
0	we will capsize ! with a blast that flecked the crests of the waves into foam , with a rattle and roar , and a vicious swish of rain , the storm broke over the gem while she was yet a mile from the camp on elm island . the boat heeled over , for her cabin was high and offered a broad surface to the wind .
0	how did he get in ? " i do not know , indeed , brother , " said gluck , in great terror .

0	as i am , i can see no reason why you should not make furious love to me , if it would amuse you . there 's no harm in firing your pistol at a person who 's bullet-proof , " oh , yes , the english are consummate hypocrites . but there 's only one objection to their hypocrisy -- it so rarely covers any wickedness . it 's such a disappointment to see a creature stalking toward you , laboriously draped in sheep 's clothing , and then to discover that it 's only a sheep . you , for instance , as i took the liberty of intimating a moment ago , in spite of your perfectly respectable appearance , are a perfectly respectable woman . if you were not , would not i be making furious love to you , though " !

0	i have not been a hospital nurse for twenty years , miss lampton , for nothing . you can comfort yourself with the fact that a good worker always makes herself felt in whatever capacity she is in . no sentiment or romance finds its way into an area-pantry , though there 's plenty of it in the wards . but in spite of that , your romance seems to have progressed . i wish you every happiness and the best of luck .
0	any of them purple-haired broads i know would be crazy scared . you ' re different . gerri stood with folded arms and looked at him . " do what you have to do . as far as i can see , you ' re the only person in this city that has even a little bit of right on his side " .

0	god save the king ! god save iskander , king of epirus ! " it is to thee , great sir , that epirus owes its security , " said an ancient chieftain , addressing iskander , " its national existence , and its holy religion . all that we have to do now is to preserve them ; nor indeed do i see that we can more effectually obtain these great objects than by entreating thee to mount the redeemed throne of thy ancestors . therefore i say god save iskander , king of epirus " !

0	i make a specialty of salads and sorbets , i guess i could roast meat and make bread ; but circumstances have not yet compelled me to do it . but i have a theory that an american woman can do anything she puts her mind to .

0	ca not i though ? in work of that kind you get into every variety of place ; and some of it is new to you . never mind ! no one can contaminate you . it is the law that only a man can degrade himself . knowing things will not harm you . doing them is a different matter . what you know will be a protection . what you do ruins -- if it is wrong . you are not harmed , you are only disgusted . think it over , and in a few days come back and get your money . it is strictly honest . you earned every cent of it .
0	now who 's growling about the loss of a skin ? one marten more or less will not make much difference . but the revelation of the next few miles drove all thought of a day of rest or a caribou hunt from the mind of the indian , for real trouble began with the second trap visited in the afternoon . this trap which had been set upon the trunk of a leaning tree , was found dangling empty by its chain , and held firmly between its jaws was the frozen leg of a marten . the keen eyes of ' merican joe saw at a glance that the animal had neither gnawed nor twisted its own way out of the trap but had been torn from it by violence . the indian scowled darkly at certain telltale tracks in the snow , and an exclamation of anger escaped him .
0	it 's a good thing i am the only witness , the poorness of your jokes alone would have horrified your colleagues , but to see you eating such a tea must have meant a request for your resignation - it is so incompatible with the dignity of a cabinet minister .

0	as i tell you midget , you must use your common- sense and reason in such matters . if you make mistakes the experience will help you to learn ; but i am sure a child twelve years old ought to know better than to slide down a steep barn roof . but i suppose molly put you up to it , and so it was not your fault exactly . " grandma , " she said , " then must i obey every rule that you would make if you thought of it , and how shall i know what they are " ?
0	o , he 's gathering it up for some one who will know how to spend it ! chang wang is merely fishing for others ; what he gathers , they will enjoy .
0	you shut up ! you ole --
0	stop , stop ! you have driven bessie away and now you want to kill me ! i do not know about anything -- you know i do not . just the other day bessie spoke something about the stocks ; i thought from what she said that you had taken them back for some purpose .

0	you speak of dishonor when you are refusing to attack an enemy in the field at the order of your seigneur ? simon 's fear transmuted itself to anger . these men were a disgrace to chivalry . worse , as marshals of an army commanded by king louis 's brother , they dishonored france . he almost wanted to draw his sword against them , his disgust was so great .
0	it 's all right , a good deal has boiled away , but the primus stove evidently went out in time to prevent the bottom being boiled out of the pot . want of paraffin , i expect .

0	no wonder ! i had it all the time . thank you ever so much . as burnamy passed her , she let him see that she had both her gloves , and her heart yearned upon him for his instant smile of intelligence : some men would have blundered out that she had the lost glove in her hand . he came back directly , saying , " no , he did not find it " .
0	bah ! what 's the good of that to me ? no . keep it -- why , it is not worth more than fifty pounds ! you surely do not think i ' m going to let you have your affectionate letter for that sum , do you ?

0	never fear , master landlord , you shall drink of your best at my expense , i promise you . we will hob-a-nob together , i tell you . keep me your best bedroom , lavender-scented linen and all . i will take my ease here till i set up my spanish castle on english earth , and in the mean time i swear i will never quarrel with your reckoning . i have lived so long upon others that it is only fair another should live upon me for a change . so fill mugs again , master landlord , and let us have a chat .

0	naturally . also on thursdays , saturdays , mondays , fridays , wednesdays and tuesdays . but sundays did sort of burrow a little further under my tough hide . and you know that 's quite an admission for anybody that was brought up by aunt mirabelle . she used to make virtue so darned scaly and repulsive that it 's a wonder i have got a moral left . as it is , my conscience may be all corrugated like a raisin , but i ' m almost glad we _can ' t_ run sundays . that is , i would be if my last remaining moral were not going to be so expensive .

0	as you have not old friends here , you should make your life a success -- ah , there is the open door , boland , and your mistress standing in it . but i come without my family , and with no fell purposes . i will not debilitate the cook ; i will not exhaust the fowl- yard . a roasted plantain is good enough for me . " why , your honour , it is the custom for a man and his whole family to go on a visit to a neighbour , perhaps twenty or forty miles away , bring their servants -- maybe a dozen or more -- and sit down on their neighbour 's hearthstone . there they eat his food , drink his wine , exhaust his fowl- yard and debilitate his cook -- till all the resources of the place are played out ; then with both hands round his friend 's neck the man and his people will say adieu , and go back to their own accumulated larder and await the return visit . the wonder is jamaica is so rich , for truly the waste is harmful . we have the door open in virginia , but not in that way . we welcome , but we do not debauch " .
0	oh , at this time , heigh ! and i suppose they think over there on the east side that it ' d been wise to strike before we got the elevated . what do you think ?

0	we are none of us so gayly as we were being , lili . the summer is going .

0	yes , i suppose he would . even i can hear the attraction in his voice . it will be splendid when he begins to feel his feet in the law courts . we will make a celebrity of him , shall we - just for the interest of it . but it 's to be only a hobby , lorraine , no entanglements , mind " he would need to speak through a grating trumpet as well " .

0	that means you ' re going to say something about girls ' wearing corsets . but some of your indians flattened their babies ' heads , and that 's worse than wearing corsets . " did not i ? the old fellows -- or the squaws -- wove a close netting of yucca fiber , and then tied on little bunches of down feathers , overlapping , just the way feathers grow on a bird . some of them were feathered on both sides . you can not get anything warmer than that , now , can you ? -- or prettier . what i like about those old aborigines is , that they got all their ideas from nature " .

0	good ! i will report again this afternoon or to-night .
0	where is brewster ? there was a wild rush for the upper deck , and vanderpool was not the hero of the hour . the " flitter " had turned and was steaming back over her course . two small boats were racing to the place where reggy 's unknown had gone over .

0	what 's he going to do ? i had slipped into my seat and the mate was changing with tom again , bent upon using the gun for the finishing touches . suddenly the old bull started . he did not come for the boat but headed directly for the bark , lying not more than half a mile away . he went so fast we could scarcely see the harpoon line . he made the sea about him boil , and the waves in his wake ( for we were close up to him ) almost swamped us .
0	why , bless my soul , amabel , i think you grow heavier every day . " no , no " ! she cried , as the squire tried to take it from her . " lift me in , daddy , lift me in " !
0	that 's so ! " do not know , " admitted another ; " but i will bet my clothes he is all right ! frank merriwell is on the level " !
0	just forget jack o ' judgment for a minute and think of yourself , you have made your pile , and you find england 's getting a bit too hot for you , do not you ?
0	name ? the man was dragged unceremoniously from the boat , and stood before the hard-faced sergeant .
0	halt ! what 's this ?
0	no , they will not do that . i think it is rather kind of them to take me without references , do not you ? " do not let them bully you " ! said green .
0	indeed you will not , we ' re not afraid of getting our feet wet . come on , girls , it 's only two feet deep ! roll up your skirts and take off your shoes and stockings , and we will wade ashore .

0	hurrah ! four to one in favor of longley ! during their half of the inning longley academy managed to make two runs , and this was increased by two more at the end of the fourth inning . in the meantime the best colby hall could do was to get two hits and bring in one run .

0	then go on your knees and thank him yourself , henri marais , i give thanks for the safe return of allan here , though it is true they would be warmer if he had left this stinkcat behind him . allemachte ! henri marais , why do you make so much of this portuguese fellow ? has he bewitched you ? or is it because he is your sister 's son , or because you want to force marie there to marry him ? or is it , perhaps , that he knows of something bad in your past life , and you have to bribe him to keep his mouth shut ?
0	oh , frank will be all right , he 's a good scout . just had a sort of exiled feeling for a moment . he 's a countryman like the rest of us . he does not like to leave home . i ' m glad for him to go . he will see something of the world .

0	how are the other fellows over your way feeling about it ? " work ? that 's what i ' m here for , " declared o ' grady brightly . " and if i slip up on any of these little notions , why i will just take a hand in the painting itself -- did not i help on a panorama once ? sure thing . there was a time when i could kind o ' swing a brush , and i guess i could do it yet . let 's see : ' the goddess of finance , ' in robes of saffron and purple , ' declaring a quarterly dividend end_sentence_quote gold background . stock-holders summoned by the genius of thrift blowing fit to kill on a silver trumpet . scene takes place in an autumnal grove of oranges and pomegranates -- trees loaded down with golden eagles and half-eagles . marble pavement strewn with fallen coupons . could not i do a fairy-scene like that ? i should say " ! little o ' grady threw out his leg again with sudden vehemence and toppled over among dill 's heaped-up cushions .
0	to that amount only ? pooh ! her death will buy more than that . as no one single office will insure for more than 5,000 pounds , and as it was easy to persuade her that such offices were liable to failure , and that it was usual to insure in several , and for a larger amount than the sum desired , i got her to enter herself at three of the principal offices . the amount paid to us on her death will be 15,000 pounds . it will be paid ( and here i have followed the best legal advice ) in trust to me for your benefit . hence , therefore , even if our researches fail us , if no son of yours can be found , with sufficient evidence to prove , against the keen interests and bought advocates of heirs-at-law , the right to laughton , this girl will repay us well , will replace what i have taken , at the risk of my neck , perhaps , -- certainly at the risk of the hulks , -- from the capital of my uncle 's legacy , will refund what we have spent on the inquiry ; and the residue will secure to you an independence sufficing for your wants almost for life , and to me what will purchase with economy , a year or so of a gentleman 's idle pleasures . are you satisfied thus far ?
0	he 's got you there , hyman , oh , the kid 's going to be one of us , all right . he 's no bouquet chaser .

0	yes ; the night to avoid dangerous questions at mess , dan , are you still going to try to catch barnes ?
0	not unless you want to be haunted by his ghost . he laughed . " then i am not to sleep in the canopy bed " ?
0	it 's simply something for you to keep in mind , my boy -- about the bank . it 's a possible career , unless you want to go on with the orpheum . of course , you ' d have to start pretty low , at first , but you know as well as i do that nobody 's asked to come into _that_ bank unless he 's well thought of .

0	bishop malthouse ! " and i never looked at allee 's album all the while i was here ! i had to come , else grandma could not , ' cause the girls are all in school ' xcept hope , and she has gone to see the _iniquities_ at the library . so i brought this along to keep myself awake with , ' cause i thought it would likely be a stupid , sleepy meeting today . they always are when a lot of fat old ladies get to talking _ecstatics_ , " -- she meant statistics -- " but i have had a very nice time listening and watching those funny preachers ; and i ' m glad you came along to talk to me -- "
0	hi ! i looked up and saw a round , pink face , with grey whiskers east and west of it , staring down from an upper window .
0	why did not you get out of it ? the water was not over my head , you chunk , professor zepplin shook him roundly .
0	i really do not think i deserve a very great deal of pity . as i have said , i will probably come out all right next year if i can only keep expenses down . " oh " ! she exclaimed , " i ' m so sorry " .
0	apples ! apples , meg ! big ones !
0	all right , but i was not hungry for my breakfast .
0	i shall be very happy to go , " miss dudley , may lone star and i have the pleasure of your comradeship for the next hour " ? he invited , bowing low .
0	you have been wondrously slow then in your growth , i think i could jump over your head .
0	that 's your mark ? you will hae tu wait for she !
0	me want annie ; me want my own annie , " oh , that is quite impossible , " said hester , a shudder passing through her . " annie can not come here . the doctor specially said that none of the girls were to come near nan " .
0	no , i do not care how you get it , or whether you get it at all or not , " just one word , major , and then i will leave off and quit a-pestering you , " he exclaimed . " if you will not make them two fellows give back the plunder they have stolen from me , you will not raise any row if i go to work and get it back in my own way , will you " ?
0	no , you dear old goose ! that was just a charge of my new explosive -- a small charge , too . but it seems to have done the work .
0	forget it ! would _you_ quit _me_ ? not any . d ' ye think i could look casey in the face , or sheila , or my old dad ? would one of _them_ quit _you_ ? you bet they would not . i will see this through . here , gimme what rifle cartridges you got , and shut up that line of talk . i will not stand for it , and i will not go .

0	he 's wondering if we ' re going to hoist the mud-hook , the chug-chug of the twin motors was heard over on the seventy-footer , and soon an unknown man , his cap pulled well down over his eyes , appeared at the stern of the drab . he took a long , keen look at the " restless " .
0	only polly , " who , who was calling " ? asked eva starting out of sleep .
0	the monkey ! he laid down the pitchfork , went outside , closed the door , and latched it . laddie called to him , but he ran to the house . when laddie and i finished our work , and his , and wanted to go , we had to climb the stairs and leave through the front door on the embankment .
0	you boys go at it like troopers , you will have to pitch your own , too , after to-day , philip .
0	oh , that 's different ! i was wondering how a real elephant could get inside your car -- unless he was a baby one .
0	with what ? " that 's precisely it , " said the landlord , " and i told him he could not sell it here , the market 's overstocked " .
0	ho , ho , ho ! uncle charlie , you look as if you had been dragged through a slough . you are just painted with mud from top to toe . well , i never did see such a looking scarecrow !

0	i am going to new york on business very soon . i have a big scheme on hand , and want to be on the field proper to pull the ropes and handle the ribbons . we will let you in on the inside if you say so , doctor , mr . pontellier turned before leaving to say :
0	oh , bupps ! if you ' d only make love to me in that ardent fashion , i ' d drag you to the altar by your few remaining hairs .
0	your honor ? " is it not the truth ? and more " -- with a harsh laugh -- " i am even told that in your wonderful country the rejected suitor -- _mon dieu ! _ -- often acts as best man at the wedding -- that the body-guard on the holy occasion may be composed of a sad but sentimental phalanx from the army of the refused . but with us russians these matters are different . we can not thus lightly control affairs of the heart ; they control us , and -- those who flirt , as you call it , must pay . the code of our honor demands it -- "

0	only a talking ? you be happy woman , in good sooth , if your worsest trouble be a comb that hath his teeth split .
0	i thought you were cross . " how long ago it seems -- that day when you spoke to me through the hedge . you must have thought i was a dreadful muff , " said maurice .
0	i can not imagine , but i will bet it 's something awful -- else he ' d have told us .
0	you have your father 's great soul , nigel , but you have not his mighty breadth of shoulder and length of limb . there was not in all the king 's great host a taller or a stronger man . his harness would be little use to you . no , fair son , i rede you that when the time comes you sell this crumbling house and the few acres which are still left , and so go forth to the wars in the hope that with your own right hand you will plant the fortunes of a new house of loring . nigel looked up wistfully at the old armor which was slung on the beams above him . " the ash spear is good , " said he , " and so is the oaken shield with facings of steel . sir roger fitzalan handled them and said that he had never seen better . but the armor -- "
0	ken , listen ! look into my mind . you can link up with me : go ahead and do it . you can read me clear down to the subconscious if you want to .
0	well , this is sure to be a hot time ! then every college boy in the house arose and bowed with great gravity toward the box .

0	help ! help ! i shall be strangled .
0	not a bad diagnosis . why do not you take up a hobby , mr . jones ? " exactly . boredom is simply romanticism with a morning-after thirst . you ' re panting for romance , for something bizarre . egypt and st . petersburg and buenos ayres and samoa have all become commonplace to you . you have overdone them . that 's why you ' re back here in new york waiting with stretched nerves for the adventure of life to cat-creep up from behind and toss the lariat of rainbow dreams over your shoulders " .
0	mates , there 's another word as some on us wad like to say to the master , and that 's about the timber .
0	not much she is not ! peck fully feels the importance of that star he wears . i think he would tackle a herd of elephants , if they were breaking the law .
0	with the students , yes . there 's nothing to be done there . the professors -- i do not think they like him much ; he is too clever . when he came into the class-room and talked latin to johnson , the professor of latin , and johnson could only stammer out a word or two , i guess he did not make a friend ; she thought intently , while the colour rose in her cheeks ; she was eager to help .
0	wait ! please ! listen , please ! * * *
0	anyhow , no woman keeps me ! they heard joe climb into his wagon outside and curse at his horses . instead of turning into the road , he drove back to the door and pulled up . bela turned pale again .
0	keep back , davie ! are ye daft ! damn ye , keep back ! your blood be on your ain heid then !
0	good-riddance to that thing , i will make you a blade that will slice through an anvil .
0	well , i have been lucky twice to-day , and i reckon i have not worn out the run yet . " i ' m not used to having my word doubted , " he said , " but i can not blame you for doubting it this time . i can hardly believe it myself . jim , you have struck just the one chance in a thousand years " .
0	well , i guess you earn your salary , but now , professor bumper , let 's hear from you . is there anything more about this idol of gold that you can tell us ?
0	no -- no . alone , " miss dunlap , " called murray , taking the words almost from the detective 's lips , as he opened the door and held it for her to enter .
0	little devil ! peg closed the book with a slam and took it up and held it in a threatening manner as she glared at alaric .
0	and the porridge is so hot i have burned my mouth ! " only just remembered " .
0	i ought to know that , he gave me a stiff enough beating .
0	what say you to that , se orita ? " ha ! ha ! ha " ! he laughed . " how could you take me to be so simple , so foolish ? oh , no , se orita , not until the hour that you have exchanged vows and , intoxicated by love 's first kiss , he presses you to his heart , then -- then , se orita , will i lay him dead at your feet in order that you also may realize what it is to live without the one you love , " he said with a sneer , a faint smile wreathing his cruel lips as he watched the effect his words had upon her . there was a malicious gleam of exultation in his eyes as he saw her draw herself together suddenly and shudder as though struck by a knife .
0	yes , you imply that the papers were left in kurgo 's house ?
0	let go of the line ! do not go any closer to the cliff !
0	it is true that the _virgen de la mar_ has brought those orders to the governor of san augustin -- and that my husband has received them . " is this true " ? i asked , for my heart misgave me .
0	if i could only be included in these outings i should love it , " and i will offer myself as chaperone , " hastily added mrs . fabian .
0	what you working at ? " what 's that ? you make money working at strike " ?
0	there 's one thing everyone knows , and that is that when max and gwen are together , they ' re sure to get into mischief . no one ever spends a minute wondering about that , because they _know_ . " i wonder what that little book was , and why he had to stop to read it " ?
0	there you go again , with your absurd notions of delicacy . believe me , grant , you do not understand women . they do not like you delicate fellows . they like a man -- like me -- a pawer of the ground -- a snorter -- a warhorse that cries ha-ha among the trumpets . arkwright felt like kicking him and showed it . " what a bounder you are at times , josh , " he snapped .
0	he would not help me , so why should he help you ?
0	well , they do , it 's made me a terribly unpopular character ! i do a lot of things they hate . for instance , at a dance i ' d a lot rather find some clever old woman and talk to her than dance with nine-tenths of these nonentities . i usually do it , too .
0	then i guess i will not open the door , perhaps you will not object to telling me what your business is in these parts .
0	not alone , let 's go up .
0	you ' re crazy ! it 's impossible ! the projector 's triggered to shut off if the patron 's in danger .
0	and you could not if there were ? " mrs . ashgrove ? well , there 's not much to tell " .
0	trouble fell downstairs ! " it 's trouble , mother " ! announced teddy . " i was playing bucking bronco and -- "
0	if you had sailor blood in you , you would not feel that way . ask grandfather . " when is not it ? last year , with the submarines , it was -- a monster . i saw a picture once in a gallery , ' the eternal siren , ' just the sea . and a woman asked , ' where 's the siren ? ' "
0	i did not buy it , " how foolish , tess , to go and buy me such a beautiful thing as this , " i said .
0	good ! we can dose him easily . you just leave that for me .
0	quite ready , " ready for breakfast " ? he inquired .
0	venture and be damned , " that is a matter for your lordship . but if i might venture -- "
0	a star in the sky , you dope ! wait will uncle al hears what a meanie you are . if i was not your sister you would not dare grab a paper that does not belong to you .
0	i thought he ' d get tired of it , a mexican miner has to have someone to keep him on the job . and i do not believe that kie wicks will spend much time over here .
0	by the pans of julius caesar ! i will put you to sleep so you will never wake up if i hears any more about you an ' yore two bits !
0	my deal is a big one , i can probably arrange with this gentleman to let him have his farm .
0	yes , that 's where giraffe feels at home . give him a chance to start a blaze , and you will make him happy , " how about the fire building tests " ? demanded giraffe , eagerly .
0	hold fast ! hold fast ! and we shall be carried safely through .
0	i have had twenty-five of them made . they cost , with the fittings , $ 100 apiece , $ 2,500 . i will rent them to you , miss bell , at a rate of 10 per cent . interest ; only $ 250 a year ! " it 's the prettiest thing i ever saw , " she said . " look , diantha ; here 's for soup , here 's for water -- or wine if you want , all your knives and forks at the side , japanese napkins up here . its lovely , but -- i should think -- expensive " !
0	yes , take your money , and leave me in peace !
0	you will think me of a sentimental race , and i will not deny it -- but it 's a fact that i was touched .
0	cheer up , nat , do not exhaust yourself ; keep your hands quiet and tread water .
0	i do hope i sha not have to go on tomorrow to new york ; but these bishops of ours are such gad-abouts one never knows where to catch them . as like as not sanderson may be down in new york , on book-concern business or something ; and if he is , i shall have to chase him up . but , after all , perhaps the trip will do me good -- the change of air and scene , you know . alice 's face showed surprise , but no trace of suspicion . she spoke with studied amiability during the meal , and deferred with such unexpected tact to his implied desire not to be questioned as to the mysterious motives of the journey , that his mood instinctively softened and warmed toward her , as they finished supper .
0	i thought so , it came to me in a dream , i guess . but you do not need to feel badly . you say i ' m the boss , yet i never thought of it . you see , the trouble is that all the balloon ascensions ordinarily are made from the large cities of america or europe . who ever thought of ascending a mountain to get a start ? but since we have done so we must figure accordingly .
0	i always sing to baby , the criminals began to laugh at the coincidence .
0	that , is , of course , the great difficulty . duvall , who is married , lives with his wife on their farm near washington . they both have plenty of money , and he has practically retired from professional work .
0	words never killed any one , bob , so keep it up if it makes you feel better . i ' m used to your complaints , " naturally , you find your level in a common country home and family " ! said barbara in an unpleasant voice .
0	ha , ha , too late ! the birds have flown , this was why , when mrs . beamish flourished open the door , exclaiming in a hearty tone : " an '' ere you will find ' em , gents -- sittin ' at their needles , busy as bees " ! the most conspicuous object in the room was a very neat leg , clad in a white stocking and black prunella boot , which was just being drawn up over the sill . it flashed from sight ; and the patter of running feet beat the floor of the verandah .
0	i want to go now , " i have a fine cargo of fish , " he said , " and i shall go out on the morning tide , before you are awake , little maid , " with a nod to anne . " next spring you and aunt martha shall go with me and see the fine town of boston , with its shops and great houses . the british soldiers will be gone by that time , and it may be we will have our own government . there will be good days for us all then " .
0	ingenious , s -- th , at any rate , but i do not agree with you . a robber on the highway , must , in the general case , have courage . he braves public opinion , he laughs at the gallows , and he throws himself right against a man in bold competition , without knowing often whether he is a giant or a dwarf .
0	drunkard brown is on the town -- on the town -- on the town ! " they got here first , " i argued . " they have had time to tell their own story . that may account for our cold reception by the germans . he says they ' re under arrest . that may be true , or it may be a trick . it 's perfectly obvious coutlass wanted to start a fight , and i ' m dead sure he was not taking such a chance as it seemed . who wants to look behind the cactus hedge and see whether he has friends in ambush " ?
0	go on , drive on . do not stop .
0	yes , yes , that 's nothing to me , of course . but you will do better to wait for the train at bridger , mr . -- ? i do not believe i have your name ?
0	do not talk slang to me , but go on and tell me about bean-pod .
0	oh , gaberelle ! slowly esmeralda opened her eyes . she saw clayton . she saw the jungle about her .
0	sway away ! these successive orders were now jerked out in rapid rotation by mr bitpin , who stood at the poop-rail bellowing away like a wild bull , captain farmer remaining alongside him and surveying with critical eye all that was done as the hands scrambled up the rigging and bustled about the deck , casting off ropes and getting the booms prepared ; until , anon , the captains of the fore and maintops and the captain of the forecastle , as well as the gunner 's mate , whose task it was to see to the main topmast studding sail , reported " all ready " !
0	you foolish girl ! why , he cares nothing about you . the idea of your having your head turned by a little politeness ! " i will not stand it , " susan repeated , advancing threateningly " he loves me and i love him " .
0	and to-morrow night thou shalt be called eric one-eye , " eyes and limbs are a poor man 's wealth , " said eric : " so be it . i stake my right eye against the sword whitefire , and we will try the match to-morrow " .
0	but the sentiment -- come now -- the sentiment ? do you perceive any hint of emptiness -- despair ? " well , in the first place , my luncheon did not disagree with me . it never does " .
0	i ' m afraid there are moments in life when even schubert has nothing to say to us . we must admit , however , that they are our worst . " she 's a frenchwoman , " isabel said to herself ; " she says that as if she were french " . and this supposition made the visitor more interesting to our speculative heroine . " i hope my uncle 's doing well , " isabel added . " i should think that to hear such lovely music as that would really make him feel better " .
0	nurse ! she patted their heads , handed them the rolls and wiped their faces with maternal solicitude . she loved them and fussed over them as though they were her own children .
0	dear , it 's all the more reason why we should be married at once . i ' d dare him to annoy you then . " i ' m not a weak woman , " she began , staring at the naked candle- flame which gave light to the tent . " it was not weakness that impelled me to marry a man i did not love ; it was the determination to get ahead and the ambition to make something worth while out of myself -- a form of selfishness , perhaps , but i tell you all women are selfish . anyhow , he seemed to promise better things and to open a way whereby i could make something out of my life . instead of that he opened my eyes and showed me the world as it is , not as i had imagined it to be . he was -- no good . you may think i was unhappy over that , but i was not . really , he did not mean much to me . what did grieve me , though , was the death of my illusions . he was mercenary -- the fault of his training , i dare say -- but he had that man-call i spoke about . it 's really a woman-call . he was weak , worthless , full of faults , mean in small things , but he had an attraction and it was impossible to resist mothering him . other women felt it and yielded to it , so finally we went our separate ways . i have seen nothing of him for some time now , but he keeps in touch with me and -- i have sent him a good deal of money . when he learns that i have prospered in a big way he will undoubtedly turn up again " .
0	march , i will do it ! fulkerson struck his hat sharply backward . " ah , dad burn it ! to give that thing the right kind of start i ' d walk up and down broadway between two boards , with the title-page of every other week facsimiled on one and my name and address on the -- "
0	you ' d never get an offer , for you have not any to sell . why do you ask , mr . burnit ?
0	not bad ! not bad ! if it was not for us sticking together . not bad ! they ai not never bad when they ai not got a chawnce , blast their black ' arts .
0	sixty thousand instead of one hundred and twenty thousand ! what does this mean ? what have ye done with my army ?
0	yes . we were with the lentilhons in their car , and the funniest thing happened the next day on the way home ! crusty old farmer would not turn out on the road , and guy lentilhon lost control and smashed straight through his wagon ! w-what do you think it was loaded with ?
0	that is of little moment ; long or short , a man can only give himself . our lord was not here very long . my dear friend , i ' m really doing very well . of course i get tired . then i come up again . and every now and then i get a lift . did jack tell you about henderson ?
0	ah , that 's asking too much of me ! you may be satisfied , however , that it 's not through defrauding my neighbours . it 's comparatively easy to be rich if you have coaxed any of mother nature 's secrets out of her . she is very kind to her children , if they are kind to her , -- in fact , she spoils them , for the more they ask of her the more she gives . besides , every man should make his own money even if he inherits wealth , -- it is the only way to feel worthy of a place in this beautiful , ever-working world .
0	you ' d better be careful what you say ! unless i ' m mistaken , you were hunting something the moment you saw me . you were hunting a hole .
0	well , here i am . why will not i do ?
0	ah , mon pauvre enfant , he has the fever ! they picked him up tenderly , and started to carry him home . but he cried and clung to the mother , and begged not to go .
0	yes , i am , you do not want work again , do you ?
0	cripes -- put that damn shiv away , tif ! or lose it someplace !
0	who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury ? does landlordism give you control of the immortal souls of those that toil for you ? i have been your physician . am i to expect tomorrow your ukase that i give up scotch and soda or your patronage ? bah ! ford , you take life too seriously . besides , when joe got into that smuggling scrape ( he was not in your employ , either ) , and he sent word to you , asked you to pay his fine , you left him to do his six months ' hard labour on the reef . do not forget , you left joe garland in the lurch that time . you threw him down , hard ; and yet i remember the first day you came to school -- we boarded , you were only a day scholar -- you had to be initiated . three times under in the swimming tank -- you remember , it was the regular dose every new boy got . and you held back . you denied that you _could_ swim . you were frightened , hysterical -- " for immoral living , if you please " .
0	but who ? i insist --
0	down , tyrant ! they were his last words on earth .
0	you ' re fortunate , to be so easily interested .
0	you ' d better keep to something vague that can be construed two ways , like the delphic oracle or _old moore 's almanac_ , it was a three-mile walk from the woodlands to the snowdrop meadows -- first along the high road , with an occasional short cut across a field or through a spinney , then down a deep , narrow lane past a farm , where the sight of a new-born lamb ( the first of the season ) caused great excitement . some of the girls , who loved old superstitions , pretended to divine their luck by whether it was standing facing them or otherwise when they first caught a glimpse of it ; but , the general verdict deciding that it was exactly sideways , they found it impossible to give any accurate predictions for the future .
0	hilloa ! there was he , whistling like fury , and , at the same time , beating his heels to the tune against the empty casks . we came up to him , and he took no notice of us at all , but kept on in the same way .
0	do not they ? you talk as if i was ditched by a hog every fool-day o ' the week . i ai not friends with all the cussed half-fed shotes in the state o ' new york . no , indeed ! yes , this is him -- an ' look what he 's done !
0	well , one thing is sure , if you do not keep mum , you will be a mighty sick coon the day after to-morrow .
0	we will see about it , well , come up now . i ordered the breakfast for two , and i see smith is bringing the dishes across from the kitchen .
0	a soft place ? if you think so , just take a drop in there yourself .
0	you ' re getting on , elizabeth . a month ago you could not have made such a remark . you were too literally literal . but as to the best parents ; i have them shut up in this room . " i have met them , " responded elizabeth . " they are in bitumen at this minute " .
0	it seems to me , you ' re altogether too anxious over this business . everybody knows you ' re tricky . and i begin to think you ' re trying to get me into trouble .
0	what a happy saying that is , i wonder sometimes how conversation was ever carried on before it was invented .
0	oh , master , my master ! look here , my dear master harry ! here 's plenty of money -- here 's twenty-three five-guineas . here 's gold moidore from virginia -- here -- no , not that -- that 's keepsakes the girls gave me . take everything -- everything . i go sell myself to-morrow morning ; but here 's plenty for to-night , master !
0	oh , i did not agree to do that , " hum " ! said tom , musingly . " yes , that would be a simple way out , and i will do it , if you will tell me how to breathe in a vacuum " .

0	and do you ? he 's no more dying than i am . that 's only the effect of the shock . did not i tell you this morning ? you probably will not be able to stop him just yet from thinking he 's dying -- it is a horrid feeling -- but you need not think so yourself , mrs . fores . dr . yardley smiled carelessly .
0	be my own brave girl , and help me . you have only to look at me , as you know , to make me forget everything . and that must not be . we have got to be serious for a little -- have you ever thought , louise , how seldom you and i have talked seriously together ? there was never time , was there ? . in all these weeks . there was only time to tell you how much you are to me . -- but now -- well , so many things were running in my head this afternoon . this letter from home was the beginning of them . read it -- this page here , at least -- and then i will tell you what i have been thinking .

0	too fine ? " no man 's got a right to make folks talk about a nice girl , " said the corporal ; " and the feller that told me about it said he reckoned you two was in love " . he hurried along now without offering her a chance to speak .

0	you ' re a fine-looking bunch to begin the winter 's work , it ought to be very easy to you youngsters .
0	it 's rather absurd , do not you think ? " is not this a lark ? let 's sit down , " stefan exclaimed , leading the way to a couch .
0	oh , if you listen to mother -- " oh , randy , she 's a year and a half , " becky protested . " your mother says that you talked in your cradle " .
0	_meget vel_ , " so do you , sir , " said ole , with a low bow to monsieur badois .
0	oh , _please_ go ! at last there was only one . he and harry jumped about and snapped and barked , and harry was thinking with joy that he was the last , when the clock in the hall gave that whirring sound which some clocks do before they strike , as if it were clearing its throat .
0	hello , humpy , sauntering sullenly homeward from his interview with the boss and with his temper rasped to a raw edge by his father 's wrathful comments upon his " dommed waggin ' tongue , " he welcomed with quite unusual eagerness the opportunity for indulging himself in his pastime of baiting humpy wicksy whom he overtook on his way home from school during the noon intermission .

0	that was nice ! " i lost my doll , " said margy , " but dick raked her up and i did give him a kiss " .
0	well , you have got us , all right , and a nice little bunch of prisoners in addition to prove that we have not been loafing on the job , but how did you come to find us ?
0	hurrah ! wo not uncle randolph be glad when he hears of this !
0	i can tell you that ! " i can only say this , " said pledge : " that i never saw three boys imitate guilt better . if they had not done it , i should like to ask them why they quaked in their shoes whenever they met me , and why they sent me a round robin , asking me not to tell about them " ?

0	we all know who closed the break , my boy . i suppose you are planning to stay with the railroad ? the younger man did not remind mr . greenfield of the many times the company had been urged to make the improvements that would have prevented the disaster , nor did he suggest that he would have remained with the company had not the president himself discharged him . " your engineer did all that any man could do after the break was made , " he said warmly . " it was the equipment and organization of the s . & c . that put the river back in its channel , and no other power on earth , under the circumstances , could have done it in time to head off that back-cut " .
0	ah , the infamous fellow ! he has a knife ! " surrender " ! -- " no " ! -- " surrender " ! -- " no " ! and in a flash stardi recovered his feet , clasped franti by the body , and , with one furious effort , hurled him on the pavement , and fell upon him with one knee on his breast .
0	very well ! you shall be shot in his place !
0	fire ! for the ventura , like other allied ships plying in the seas in those days , carried small guns for defensive purposes . the gun crew sprang to obey this order and the gun was trained on the submarine .

0	my dear , dear lady , i have not the least intention in the world of asking your daughter to marry me . " i mean marry her ! -- oh , she 's my main hold on life " !
0	you mean i ' m to go away ? " nobody yet , " he said .
0	well , you big cut throat , why do not you do it ?
0	we will settle that , there 's always a way to do a thing . on either side there 's a door . let 's see if one of those happens to be unfastened .

0	do you remember my freckles and red hair ? " you must not run away , mazie wetherell , " he said ; " you used to treat me better than that when you were a little girl " .
0	that 's all right , i think the only thing you can say is that you are less hungry some times than others . we can stop anywhere you want .
0	he seemed to be shy of them , he said it had a tendency to lead one into dangerous fields . but oh ! i forgot -- i asked my swami also , and it did not startle him . they are used to ghosts ; they believe that souls keep coming back to earth , you know . i think if it was his ghost , i would not mind seeing it -- for he has such beautiful eyes . he gave me a book of hindu legends -- and there was such a sweet story about a young princess who loved in vain , and died of grief ; and her soul went into a tigress ; and she came in the night-time where her lover lay sleeping by the firelight , and she carried him off into the ghost-world . it was a most creepy thing -- i sat out here and read it , and i could imagine the terrible tigress lurking in the shadows , with its stripes shining in the firelight , and its green eyes gleaming . you know that poem -- we used to read it in school -- ' tiger , tiger , burning bright ! '
0	and her dad , too . is not he a nice old fellow , even though he 's awfully rich ? " oh , i wish grace hooper were here , " cora said . " she 's no snob like terry and would not she enjoy this " ?
0	you see i ' m prudence personified , i ' m taking it so leisurely that i have even sat down about it .

0	you ' re young , chris , or you would not worry about folks ' motives when their efforts suit you . what are the men doing ?

0	drink it , or i will brain you .
0	you did not see how he lived . the good things in his tent were part of his business property , handy when some mining manager , who may want work done , comes along -- or perhaps brought in by mounted messenger for miss savine 's special benefit . thurston lives on pork and potatoes , and eats them with his men . the fellow you pitied was a lazy tramp . it may not greatly matter to you or me , but thurston will do great things some day . " i hardly know , " was the answer . " he is certainly a man of strong character , but there is something about him which repels one -- something harsh , almost sinister , though this would , of course , in no way affect his business relations with you . for instance , you saw how he lives , and yet he turned away a countryman who appeared destitute and hungry " .
0	i guess he 's pretty well alive to that , if he 's in love with her . miss cotton sighed . " sometimes i wish that he did show a little more trepidation . it would seem as if he were more alive to the great difference that there is between alice pasmer and other girls " .

0	well , not ducky lucky anyway , " i think he 's wonderful , " sally exclaimed , " and the most amazing part of it is , he 's right , janet has little golden flecks in the brown part of her eye and you have not . what a way to tell you apart , but i promise not to tell " .
0	keep a-runnin , an ' you will not have to trim , " trim the yards " ! i yelled at bert rhine , who , backed for counsel by charles davis and the maltese cockney , actually came directly beneath me on the main deck in order to hear above the commotion aloft .
0	i seem to be arguing against an impenetrable obstinacy , do you , roger , who were educated under my own eye , in my house , have the effrontery to tell me that you believe miss michell is descended from the union of an evil spirit and a human being ; as the eastern legends claim for saladin the great ?
0	wha ' th ' hell ? he groped his way down the stairs and into the midst of the tumult . no one had as yet obtained a light . the leader had succeeded in partly controlling his gang , but one man had only to brush the shoulder of another to start a fight . david elbowed through them , striking right and left in the endeavor to stir up anew the panic . he succeeded instantly . in two minutes pandemonium reigned . then a man scrambled in with a lantern and was greeted with a cheer . wilson turned , shot twice , and ducked . the cabin was once more in darkness and confusion .

0	ho ! a man made that statue . it would have been quite a different scene had a lion made it !
0	it is not magic . i have seen this before . it is like greek fire , but it does not hurt . it just makes noise and smoke . daoud , having seen the tartar army in action when he visited baghdad disguised as a christian trader , recognized the fiery noisemakers .
0	my girls all have copies of the notes . pass yours , ardiune , professor edwards turned expectantly ; but the tall lady , who a moment before had been at his elbow , had strayed away , papers in hand , and was not available for reference .

0	oh , i would not say it was as bad as that , let 's have a cup of tea .
0	no , i am quite aware of that , as you have often said so before . therefore , if you become one , i am sorry to say that i do not see how you can expect any benefit . you would only be like a man who puts a sovereign into the offertory bag in mistake for a shilling . the extra nineteen shillings will do him no good at all , since in his heart he regrets the error and wishes that he could have them back .
0	what did not i hear ? but i did not do it but once or twice . i lost my head one day and began to argue the question of perspective with a couple of old codgers who were criticizing a bit of foreshortening that was my special pet . i forgot my goggles and sailed in . the game was up then , of course ; and i never put them on again . but it was worth a farm to see their faces when i stood ' discovered ' as the stage-folk say .

0	i was going to stop , anyway , now , put your hands up !
0	just that you could not sleep yourself . but it is a most godly time of night . the fact is , i would have had to get up soon to say the first part of my office . were i living with my brother franciscans -- as i wish i were -- i would be up chanting lauds with them . but i fear the cardinal will be neither willing nor able to talk to us if we go to him now .
0	i should probably ask her if i might first . " but suppose now , mr . brown , just suppose you should some day run across a young woman exactly like the sunday weeks you have described : would you marry her " ?
0	wait till you get the chance , " i mean to share it with you , when i get hold of your hair , " snapped the dragon .
0	i have not done this for him alone . i can not say that i would not have , of course , but i ' m just freezing him out this hand . it 's funny how everything reduces to poker terms , is not it ? i will send vernon in .
0	you see , that 's where the worst of the trouble is unknown . i can not -- well , i can not worry maw . she does not know it yet . i have been trying to get another job before i broke the news to her and -- well , i have not succeeded ! those worth while are afraid of me , or else have no opening . for the moment i ' m the under dog ; but -- i ' m not whipped !

0	you see if i do not . and we will live in style , and you can keep a gal and stay dolled up all the time . oh , i know how to treat you . susan was blanched and trembling . " oh , no , " she cried . " you must not do that " !

0	ah that dreadful word ' personally ' ! we ' re dying of it , for you women bring it out with murderous effect . when you meet with a genius as fine as this idol of ours let him off the dreary duty of being a personality as well . know him only by what 's best in him and spare him for the same sweet sake .

0	the lord only knows , some people say john doe , and other people say the man higher up , but which it is , or who either of ' em may be , i have not the slightest idea . maybe they belong to the copper trust .
0	i did not mean to . and now it will not fly -- fly , " oh , you -- " began polly , passionately , when she turned and saw what was done . in a minute she dashed over to joel and threw her arms around him . " you could not help it , " she finished , " and i can paste a piece of paper over it , and it will be most as good as new , " while the children stood aghast at the mischief , and ben exclaimed , " how could you , joe ! why did not you let it alone " ?

0	tim likes to remember his ' general orders , ' but he 's forgotten number five , " _si_ , " grinned the soldier-policeman , all animosity gone . and as the other two men tramped away through the mud they also grinned , looking back at the north and the south american pacing side by side in sentry-go , blowing smoke and conversing like brothers in arms .

0	it 's a joke on them , if they did . i wonder what they ' d think of hampton , if they could see it now . i counted up once , just to tease father -- he 's the seventh generation from ebenezer bumpus , who came to dolton . well , i proved to him he might have one hundred and twenty-six other ancestors besides ebenezer and his wife . " and we will go down to plymouth , too , some sunday soon , if this weather keeps up . if we start early enough we can get there for lunch , easy . we will see the rock . i guess some of your ancestors must have come over with that mayflower outfit -- first cabin , eh ? you look like it " .
0	do not tear your shirt , amigo , we will arrive faster if we do not go off half-cocked . let 's picket the broncs , amble down to the spring , and smoke a cigaret . we have got to ride twenty miles for fresh hawsses and these have got to have a little rest .

0	i think the joke 's on george more than even it is on peewee and string , " what 's the trouble " ? demanded john , who now also had climbed out of the water . his elongated form only partly clothed , his garments dripping and clinging to his slim body , increased the weirdness of his appearance .
0	you think you have turned a smart trick , do not you ? as a matter of fact the ranch belongs to him already . the man you have known as green is buck stratton himself .

" well , she has a fair half section in her own name , but i can not see as that does olaf much good . she will have a good deal of property some day , if old vavrika do not marry again . but i do not consider a saloonkeeper 's money as good as other people 's money " .
0	it 's quite true , scheherazade . otherwise , i should not have ordered my steward to throw the remains of my dinner out of the corridor porthole . no , dear child . i should have had it analysed , had your stateroom searched for more of that elusive seasoning you used to flavour my dinner ; had a further search made for a certain sort of handkerchief and perfume . also , just imagine the delightful evidence which a thorough search of your papers might reveal ! no , scheherazade ; i did not care to prove you anything resembling a menace to society . because , in the first place , i am absurdly grateful to you .

0	forgive me the liberty i take , mademoiselle , but would you so very kindly allow me to make a sketch of you sitting there ? i work very quick . i beg you will let me . i am belgian , and have no manners , you see . another november day , a saturday , leaving early , she walked to hyde park . the plane-trees were just at the height of their spotted beauty . few -- very few-yellow leaves still hung ; and the slender pretty trees seemed rejoicing in their freedom from summer foliage . all their delicate boughs and twigs were shaking and dancing in the wind ; and their rain-washed leopard-like bodies had a lithe un-english gaiety . noel passed down their line , and seated herself on a bench . close by , an artist was painting . his easel was only some three yards away from her , and she could see the picture ; a vista of the park lane houses through , the gay plane-tree screen . he was a tall man , about forty , evidently foreign , with a thin , long , oval , beardless face , high brow , large grey eyes which looked as if he suffered from headaches and lived much within himself . he cast many glances at her , and , pursuant of her new interest in " life " she watched him discreetly ; a little startled however , when , taking off his broad-brimmed squash hat , he said in a broken accent :

0	i will tell you when i have seen them , either they be gold and pearls , or they be that to which , in our earthly minds , gold and pearls come the nearest . why , my friend , we be all but lisping children to god . think you one moment , and tell me if every word we use touching him hath not in it more or less of parable ? we call him father , and king , and master , and guide , and lord . is not every one of these taken from earthly relationships , and doth it not presuppose a something which is to be found on earth ? we have no better wits than to do so here . if god would teach us that we know not , it must be by talking to us touching things we do know . did not you the same with your children when they were babes ? how far we may be able to penetrate , when we be truly men , grown up unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of _christ_ , verily i cannot tell . only i do see that not only all _scripture_ , but all analogy , pointeth to a time when we shall emerge from this caterpillar state , and spread our wings as butterflies in the sunshine . nay , there is yet a better image in nature . the grub of the dragon-fly dwelleth in the waters , and cannot live in the air till it come forth into the final state . tell me then , i pray you , how shall this water-grub conceive the notion of flying through the air ? supposing you able to talk with him , could you represent the same unto him other than by the conceit of gliding through water with most delightsome swiftness and directness ? to talk of an element wherein he had no experience should be simply so much nonsense to him . now , it may be -- take me not , i pray you , as meaning it must be -- that all that shall be found in heaven differs as greatly from what is found on earth as the water differs from the air . concerning these matters , i take it , god teaches us by likening them to such things as we know that shall give the best conceit of them to our minds . here on earth , the fairest and most costly matter is gold and gems . well , he would have us know that the heavenly city is builded of the fairest and most precious matter . but that the matter is real , and that the city is builded of somewhat , that will i yield to none . to do other were to make it a fairy tale , heaven in cloud-land , and god himself but the shadow of a dream . the only difference i can see is , that we should never awake from the dream , but should go on dreaming it for ever .

0	generally ; that is , if i have not been doing much just before . it depends upon one 's hands . we have our game laws , but as a rule nobody worries about them , and , anyway , those birds will not nest until they reach the tundra by the polar sea . still , as i said , we never shoot them unless mrs . nansen wants one or two for the pot . " you can do that -- when they ' re right out in the sloo " ? asked agatha , who had learned that it is much more difficult to shoot with a rifle than a shot-gun , which spreads its charge .

0	i fancy your own mind is quite as coldly analytical , but nature took care of your conduits and you see to the tact . you cannot teach gora how to redistribute her magnetism , but you might give her a few points . " you ask one woman why another cannot fascinate men ! i should say that it is for want of transmission . the heart and passions are there -- i will risk guessing that she has been tragically in love at least once -- but there is something wrong with the conduit that carries sexual magnetism ; it has been bent upward to the brain instead of directed straight to the sex for which it was designed . moreover , she is too coldly and obviously analytical and lacks the tact to conceal it . men do not mind being skewered when they are out for purely intellectual enjoyment , but they do not love it " .

0	what is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you ? that 's no evidence . you may have dreamt it , that 's all ! and i tell you , you are lying , sir . you are lying and slandering from some spite against me , simply from pique , because i did not agree with your free-thinking , godless , social propositions !

0	what are you doing , higgs ? toward evening i was awakened by a fearful hubbub , in which i distinguished the shrill voice of higgs ejaculating language which i will not repeat , the baying of pharaoh , and the smothered groans and curses of an abati . running from the little tent , i saw a curious sight , that of the professor with shadrach 's head under his left arm , in chancery , as we used to call it at school , while with his right he punched the said shadrach 's nose and countenance generally with all his strength , which , i may add , is considerable . close by , holding pharaoh by the collar , which we had manufactured for him out of the skin of a camel that had died , stood sergeant quick , a look of grim amusement on his wooden face , while around , gesticulating after their eastern fashion , and uttering guttural sounds of wrath , were several of the abati drivers . orme was absent , being , in fact , asleep at the time .

0	fools , fools ! for a full two minutes the french were taken aback .
0	ah ! i was at the europe , i find their cooking better . their sterlet is even better than the hermitage at moscow . jules , the chef , was at cubat 's , in the nevski , for years .
0	all right , we can stand it . so much the better , because we have got a big run ahead tomorrow , to make up for the time lost today . i ' d give a cooky to know just where the other boats are right now . i only hope nothing has happened to either -- at least nothing serious ; because there 's just bound to be something going amiss with that engine on the _wireless_ nearly every day she runs .

0	he 's always on our side , brother councill , " well , the lord is on our side , neighbor jennings , to-day , anyhow , " he roared across the space of two or three tables .
0	not a fleeting one , joseph , but one the memory of which shall send me rejoicing through what years or days of life be left me . a satisfaction that for eighteen years i have been waiting to experience ; though the moment after it be mine find me stark and cold .
0	if it had been my husband , i should have been at the window all night , " yes , i should have heard him " .
0	yes , yes , that would just do ; and he could put on his father 's old mantle , and bring a stout crab-stick along with him . " just put on an old cloak , and speak no word ; then , neither by dress nor voice will he know thee ; besides , the night will be quite dark , so fear nothing . we will teach him , i engage , how to beat a fine young fellow again , or to rob me of my gold , as he did , the base , unworthy knave " .

0	by being a gentleman , mr . aristocrat . not in clothes , mind you -- nor money , nor furniture , nor wines , nor carriages , but in heart . think a moment , ollie , hank finds a robin that has tumbled out of its nest , and spends half a day putting it back . hank follows you up the brook and sees you try to throw a fly into a pool , and he knows just how awkwardly you do it , for he 's the best fisherman in the woods -- and yet you never see a smile cross his face , nor does he ever speak of it behind your back -- not even to me . hank walks across moose hillock to find old jonathan gordon to tell him he has some big trout in loon pond , so that the old man can have the fun of catching them and selling them afterward to the new hotel in the notch . he has walked twenty-four miles when he gets back . do these things make hank a gentleman , or not ?

0	my dear fellow , you will never make a soldier if you always want to know the ins and outs of every quarrel you have to fight about ; but for once the tenderest conscience may be satisfied as to the justice of the contention . but munro is much better versed in the history of the affair than i am ; for , to tell you the truth , beyond the fact that it is a general row between the protestants and catholics , i have not troubled myself much in the matter .
0	unless _you_ tell them what they are to do , then they know quick enough .
0	turn the searchlight on him ! lord hastings took prompt action , in spite of the fact he could not make out the enemy .
0	no , no , do not burn that ! why , man , you do not know what you do . it is unique ; it contains wisdom which is nowhere else to be found .
0	i do not know yet exactly , but i have thought of something . no ! no ! do not try to thank me for anything , for i do not know how it will come out . but , you certainly have a method of asking for things that i do not seem to find any way to refuse you .

0	he 's a contemptible little scamp ! when i took him into my drug store six years ago , he did not have a change of clothes . now he 's a millionaire . how did he get it ? he stole a formula i had used to relieve nervous headaches , mixed it in water with a little poisonous colouring matter , pushed it into the soda-fountain trade , made his first half-million , organized the american chemical company and blossomed into a magnate . and now this little soda-fountain pip threatens me with ruin unless i join his gang and help him rob my neighbours . it happens that i like my neighbours . and the more i see of this city , the more thrilling its life becomes , the more wonderful its opportunities . opportunity means one thing to me -- quite another to bivens . the world he lives in is a small one . i live in god 's big world . i belong to no class . i know them all from the lonely multimillionaire on murray hill to his equally lonely brother thief who crawls into his lair by the river . and i do not envy one more than another . my business is to heal the sick , not merely to make money . thousands of children die at my very door every summer who could be saved by a single prescription if they could get it . that 's the thought that grips me when i begin to figure the profits in this trade . i ' m making a fair living . i do not want any more out of my neighbours . i have shown you some of them to-night .

0	and a secret of polichinelle besides , everybody i know or care a snap for knows it . at the same time , no woman cares to have her age discussed , even if it is public property and she quite old enough to be beyond such vanity . no matter ; i ' m going to call you sara , if you have no objection .

0	i really believe it originated with her , but , as a matter of fact , it might have gone no further , which is an admission . still , the desire to win those spurs has been growing so strong of late that i can not resist it . in one way , i scarcely think that is very astonishing .

0	poor stuff ! alexander was no doubt inured to such a reception ; he did not disturb himself about the old man 's ill-humor , but slapped him on the shoulder with rough geniality , went up to the work-table with easy composure , took up the vice which held the nearly finished gem , and , after holding it to the light and examining it carefully , exclaimed : " well done , father ! you have done nothing better than that for a long time " .

0	y ' see , i do not mind saying things to you . you ' re my daddy and momma all rolled into one . and there 's sure a heap of you for two , maybe you do not always say all the things you feel , but it do not keep me guessing long . you ' d a heap of terr ' ble , terr ' ble things on your mind to say to me on this ride . oh , and they weighed heavy . your poor worried face had lost all its smile , and your eyes just looked as if you ' d been lying awake nights an ' nights , an ' you ' d seen every sort of nightmare ever thought of in the world of dreams . it made me kind of sorry , and i just could not wait for you to make that big talk you figgered on .

0	not on any account . i want to see the whole list of flats that mr . fulkerson thought would be the very thing for us . it was a janitress , large , fat , with her arms wound up in her apron , who received them there . mrs . march gave her a succinct but perfect statement of their needs . she failed to grasp the nature of them , or feigned to do so . she shook her head , and said that her son would show them the flat . there was a radiator visible in the narrow hall , and isabel tacitly compromised on steam heat without an elevator , as the flat was only one flight up . when the son appeared from below with a small kerosene hand-lamp , it appeared that the flat was unfurnished , but there was no stopping him till he had shown it in all its impossibility . when they got safely away from it and into the street march said : " well , have you had enough for to-night , isabel ? shall we go to the theatre now " ?

0	you want me to believe he is mad , i suppose ? " oh " ! cried tanty , shooting off the ejaculation as from a pop-gun . then , shaking herself free of rupert 's touch , she sat down abruptly in her chair again , and began fanning herself with her handkerchief . not even in her interchange of amenities with mrs . hambledon , had molly seen her display so much indignation .
0	then an agent 's station is better than an owner 's , " i will show you after we pass the bend of the stream , " the convict continued while on his hands and knees trying to ignite a fire with prairie chips , " a flock of sheep that are counted by thousands . they stretch over the land for miles in extent ; even the owner does not know how many he possesses , and has never visited his stockman , but trusts all to an agent . of course the latter has full authority to act as he pleases , and sometimes , by some mysterious process , the agent gets richer than the owner , and often buys his property , although where the money comes from , i leave you to guess " .

0	yes ; but you do not think of the situations in clelia , and what i can do with her , i see a song there that would light up all london . unfortunately , the sentiment 's dead radical . it would not so much matter if we were certain to do camillus as well ; because one would act as a counterpoise to the other , you know . well , follow your own fancy . camillus is strictly classical . i treat opera there as alfieri conceived tragedy . clelia is modern style . cast the die for camillus , and let 's take horse . only , we lose the love-business -- exactly where i show my strength . clelia in the camp of the king : dactyllic chorus- accompaniment , while she , in heavy voluptuous anapaests , confesses her love for the enemy of her country . remember , this is our romantic opera , where we do what we like with history , and make up our minds for asses telling us to go home and read our ' student 's rome end_sentence_quote then that scene where she and the king dance the dactyls , and the anapaests go to the chorus . sublime ! let 's go into the woods and begin . we might give the first song or two to-night . in composition , mind , always strike out your great scene , and work from it -- do not work up to it , or you have lost fire when you reach the point . that 's my method .

0	i should leave you nothing ! " and leave me the watch " ! hamar retorted , with a grim smile . " you are a philanthropist -- not a storekeeper " .
0	ha , ha , ha ! that 's better . that 's a good lesson before breakfast , and without a spy-glass . i shall make a man of you yet , master bart .
0	you may do that , miss bertha , i do not care how much you lock me in . when i want to go out , i shall go . i shall work , and win my freedom .

0	all right , i will send them out as i find i can , with some of the other cowpunchers , until they learn the ropes . there is too great a responsibility on a night man to trust the boys alone with that work now . but they can begin if they wish . i will see first how the bunch get back from their celebration of the glorious fourth . you will come out and have supper with us ?
0	as a matter of fact , i have an ancestral castle in the neighborhood . it is not mine , but it was my ancestors ' , and if i can not exactly entertain you in it , i can give you tea close by at a country inn . perhaps you have read about the ch teau of brederode , within a drive of haarlem ? " have you any more belongings here " ? asked the chaperon , gaily . " such as an ancestral castle , where you could give us another surprise feast " ?
0	well , brethren , open your ears ! all burst into ringing laughter , but soon fell silent , for yakov tarasovich mayakin , rising to his feet , cleared his throat , and , stroking his bald crown , surveyed the merchants with a serious look expecting attention .
0	a sight smaller than you are , do you want a ticket or not ?

0	oh , that is the fault of my doctors . they sent me to the sea to thin me down , and by their orders i was to choose a very dull , very remote bathing place , where i should be sure not to meet any acquaintances . for directly i have friends about me , i enjoy myself , laugh , talk , and then i get stout again . now to-day , for instance , i have acted contrary to my medical orders -- i have had a very pleasant chat with you .
0	they ' re amazing . of course , we have got a real white man for a skipper -- and the commander , too : that goes a long way . and they ' re away from drink and -- other things that ai not good for ' em . everybody has more leisure to devote to them than in peace-time : their amusements and recreations generally . cinema shows and regattas , boxing championships , and all the rest of it . there 's fifty per cent . less sickness and fewer punishments than we ever had in peacetime . of course , it 's an exile for the married men -- it 's rough on them , but on the whole there 's jolly little grumbling .

0	ho-ho-ho ! ha-ha-ha ! ho-ho-ho-ho ! the most extraordinary sounds arose from the veranda . had robertson gone mad , or what could be the matter with him ?
0	it would almost appear that my yacht and i are attracting a quite unusual amount of attention here , the gentlemen of whom you speak are personal friends of mine -- the younger of them , indeed , went to the same school as myself , in england -- which should be sufficient to account for my intimacy with them . but it does not follow that , because they happen to be friends of mine , i am to give a free passage to cuba to anyone who chooses to ask me . were i to do so i should probably have to carry across half the inhabitants of key west ! no , senor , i must beg to be excused .

0	you evidently think that the ' boy who would not grow up ' must have been written by a ' grown-up who could never have been a boy end_sentence_quote perhaps that is the meaning of the ' never- never land end_sentence_quote i daresay you ' re right in your criticism , but i do not agree with you about bassington . he 's a handful to deal with , as anyone knows who has come in contact with him , but if one 's hands were not full with a thousand and one other things i hold to my opinion that he could be tamed . " i am not thinking in the manner of peter pan , " said the other . " with all reverence for the author of that masterpiece i should say he had a wonderful and tender insight into the child mind and knew nothing whatever about boys . to make only one criticism on that particular work , can you imagine a lot of british boys , or boys of any country that one knows of , who would stay contentedly playing children 's games in an underground cave when there were wolves and pirates and red indians to be had for the asking on the other side of the trap door " ?

0	you ' re a good planner , ruthie , but i hardly think you will be obliged to go out as a cook just yet . i am sorry to disappoint you , but i really can not say that i have lost any money . still her father hesitated , until ruth said hopefully , " you have not lost all your money , have you ? that would be so romantic and interesting . i think i should go out as a cook , and perhaps you could get a place as butler in the same house . if it happened just now , though , i should have to feed them on birthday cake until i learned to make something else " .

0	there 's nothing i should like better than to reckon you as my ally . and now i see why we have been talking at cross-purposes . you think that i have come to wheedle terry 's address out of you . perhaps i have , since you have put the idea into my head . and with regard to my earnestness , nothing except terry in the whole world matters . she 's romance , self-fulfillment and , as you have said , the last dream of my youth . if i supposed that i were going to lose her , i would rather not have -- but i did not come here to burden you with my troubles . i came to do something for you -- something which i have tried to avoid doing . something which has forced itself upon me and followed me until -- it 's as though i ' d been compelled by a personality outside myself . i may make you very unhappy -- " you must put that out of your mind " . she said it comfortingly , as though to a little boy . " there 's nothing distasteful in what you have to say . it may cause awkwardness with sir tobias ; but if you can assure me that you ' re really in earnest over terry , i will be quite willing to risk that in order to become your ally " .

0	oh , you _are_ wrong ! i do not believe there ever was a girl who thinks less about marrying . i have never had time to think of such things . i have always -- ever since i was nine years old -- looked to the one goal , and aimed for it , studied for it , lived for it -- at last , danced towards it .

0	my honour ! my honour as a noble miner ! my glory and my pride ! all are gone , irrevocably and for ever ! and by a pack of base boors , by a puny , cream-faced , chicken-breasted , outlandish starveling , have i been robbed of it . amid all the mountains round , and doubtless in many others likewise , there was not a miner nor a mine-surveyor who could boast that he had never in his life been down in the beggarly plain . i awoke in the straw , in the corn , such was the rascals plot to ruin me . the ears were sticking in my nose and eyes when i came to myself , the sorry , brittle , bristly stuff , that i had never yet seen except in the pallet of my bed . scandal and shame ! murder and house-breaking are not so detestable ! and no law against it , no remedy , no mortal skill in the whole wide world .
0	yes , and then i started running down the street and hollered , ' throw a brick , you irish mick ! ' ?
0	it 's felix page 's birth-place ; the rest was inference . " that 's it ! but how did you know " ?
0	you have made a silly blunder , phil , " i do not know that anything is the matter with them , sir . i suppose i have made a blunder , " i replied , stammering with confusion , for the situation was entirely new to me . " the may invoice of the michigan pine company foots up on the book about fifteen thousand dollars , but the bill on file shows only five " .

0	do not linger , larry , " ay , ay , sir , " answered bill , turning from the chinaman and following his comrades with solemn stolidity , or , if you prefer the expression , with stolid solemnity .
0	of course they did so . the church was first at jerusalem , before saint peter transferred it to rome , master aristoteles ' " ah " ! might mean anything , as the hearer chose to take it .
0	let me go , you ridiculous child , the motors are coming up the hill now . make her look as pretty as you can , marie , and hurry !
0	and where are we going , when the mast 's up ? " come along " ! cried cary to the malcontents ; " we ' re raw longshore fellows , but we will not be outdone by any old sea-dog of them all " . and setting to work himself , he was soon followed by one and another , till order and work went on well enough .

0	no mention there of class hatred , i looked at him triumphantly .
0	what do you know about that ? " i ' m afraid there is not much difference in men , whatever their country . but it 's -- their attitude towards women which i hate " .
0	oh , i ' m not scared , mother , only i do not just see why murray should ask me things you do not care to ask me . that 's all .

0	no ! no ! going out . going out !

0	that 's not answering my question , do you consent to being friends with me ?
0	that gives us about half africa for hunting-ground , and a job for life ! " both ways , " announced juma without waiting for fred to interpret . he had an uncanny trick of following conversation , his intelligence seeming to work by fits and starts .
0	of course you would not , and my sister would not either , dear .
0	pegrani ! do not !
0	poor darling ! -- i mean van buren 's a poor darling , not you . you see , he 's got the nice sort of boston idea that a man ought only to send a girl flowers or books , or music . he thinks it 's respectful . but , anyway , it 's a very good sign . " yesterday , " said daphne , " he sent me that basket of american beauty roses . the day before he sent me ella wheeler wilcox 's poems " .
0	i do not doubt you have put yourself within the reach of it . but if it eases your mind to know , i am not going to law . " i do not think the worse of ' ee for fighting . you ' re not going to law then " ?

0	treachery is at work , of course there was a great deal of smoke and shouting , and getting tripped up by the hose , and it was by the merest chance bunyip bluegum glanced back in time to see the wombat in the act of stealing the puddin ' from the hollow log .
0	he 's converted you ! i swear , fulkerson , if we had accepted and paid for an article advocating cannibalism as the only resource for getting rid of the superfluous poor , you ' d begin to believe in it . " i ' m not afraid , " said fulkerson . " that thing is going to attract attention . it 's well written -- you can take the pomposity out of it , here and there and it 's novel . our people like a bold strike , and it 's going to shake them up tremendously to have serfdom advocated on high moral grounds as the only solution of the labor problem . you see , in the first place , he goes for their sympathies by the way he portrays the actual relations of capital and labor ; he shows how things have got to go from bad to worse , and then he trots out his little old hobby , and proves that if slavery had not been interfered with , it would have perfected itself in the interest of humanity . he makes a pretty strong plea for it " .
0	body of bacchus ! is it truly you , boccadoro ?
0	who are you ? the sound and the words seemed to indicate that the voice came from the bottom of the well , so inga looked down . nothing could be seen , on account of the darkness .

0	black boy ! black boy ! he is the winner for a thousand ! the spectators grew excited as the racing horses swung around the half-mile track and came flying down toward the judges ' stand on their first round . men waved their hats and cheered , the white handkerchiefs of women were fluttering .
0	because -- because i ' m wedded to my art , and i ' m not going to commit bigamy , whatever i do . this was undeniable . mrs . leighton could only demand , in an awful tone , " may i ask why -- if you cared for him ; and i know you care for him still you will refuse him " ?

0	how funny ! i am out in search of amusement , and i ' m finding it . i think i ' m perhaps a mile from our home for the summer .
0	oh , what a joke , what a joke ! i hid under a neighboring gateway to wait results . had he been well , my uncle would have half-murdered the jesuit , but i knew that he would scarcely be able to move an arm , and i asked myself gleefully what sort of a scene would take place between these antagonists , what disputes , what arguments , what a hubbub , and what would be the issue of the situation , which my uncle 's indignation would render still more tragic ?
0	you _are_ a goose , but it 's true . i have seen lots of handsomer men than you -- boris , for example ; but i have never seen one so good looking .
0	i was looking for the poem , and i see nothing but a stranger .

0	omega opens at sixty-five , i had thought the riot that had gone before as near the climax of noise as it was possible to get . i was mistaken . the roar that followed the call was to the noise that had gone before as is the hurricane to the zephyr . there was a succession of yells , hoots , cries and bellows ; men rushed wildly at each other , swung in a mad dance , jumped up and down ; and the floor became a frantic sea of fists , arms , hats , heads , and all things movable .
0	ignoranti ! fannulloni ! my house is the best on your street . the rest is one big , foul quintana . where were you idlers when my men were murdered and my women were raped by a gang of foreigners ? home pissing in your pants , eh ? brave orvietans you are . get out of my way .

0	remorse ! ha , ha , ha , ha , ha ! " aye , suffering ! from what think you ? the pangs of remorse " !
0	and he never will , i know the sort -- always going to do wonderful things in a future which never comes . well ! at any rate while he is a soldier they will teach him that he is no better than other lads that come from the same village , and not even as good , seeing that he has never any money in his wallet .
0	hi ! joey , " now then , smiler , come on " ! shouted one of the men with the engine , still hidden , but close at hand .
0	but death , you said once , is a mere stopping of animal action . why dread that ? " because i have a certain dislike of death and do not care to cause it myself if i can help it " .
0	washington does not know whether crawling water is in the united states or in timbuctoo , if we had some one in authority right here on the ground we might make him understand , but mahomet will never come to these mountains , and they can not go to mahomet . why , what 's the matter ?
0	just a moment . i did not say that . what i said was that i ' m here to stand my trial . it 's up to you to prove me guilty . " you ' re willing to assume full responsibility for the death of faulkner , are you ? ready to plead guilty , eh " ?
0	very well ; we will walk , then , if you insist upon it , " it will be much cheaper to walk , as you have to pay four marks an hour for the carriage , " pleaded the economical guide . " thorwaldsen 's museum and the northern antiquities are only a few steps from here " .
0	poor little things , how awfully lonely for them ! " i believe they used to have germans here without any mothers , " remarked sybil , " but they never do now " .
0	give me your pistol ! crash ! bang ! bang ! bang ! sounded the shots once more , and in the midst of them there came a blinding tangle of bristled , jointed legs that thrashed the deck , a thud that shook the air ship to its center , and a cry from jack , who fell on his back with a crimson line across his face .
0	let him be , giancarlo , exasperated , daoud saw that hurting sordello only made him angrier . if they hurt him enough , certainly , they would have him begging for mercy , but by then they might have injured him so badly he would be of no use to them .

0	how is that ? " from another land we are , " spoke up malay kris . " and we do have some special news for you , if you care to know " .
0	and you a blethering old idiot ! " every time you did not set him on his feet yourself , you mean . where i give one unfortunate a little private lift , you do the same for a dozen . the idea of your swelling around the country and petting yourself with the nickname of givenaught -- intolerable humbug ! before i would be such a fraud as that , i would cut my right hand off . your life is a continual lie . but go on , i have tried my best to save you from beggaring yourself by your riotous charities -- now for the thousandth time i wash my hands of the consequences . a maundering old fool ! that 's what you are " .
0	i know that , we met last week , do not you remember ?
0	no , i suppose not , doctor . still , what are we to do ? " well , yes , that might be a good plan , parkhurst , " the doctor said with a smile , " and might save us a good deal of trouble ; but , you see , we have come up here at his invitation ; we have just been eating his food and drinking his liquor , and it would scarcely place us in a favorable position in the eyes of the natives in general were we to commence our alliance with him by hanging him " .
0	oh , _that_ day ! i did not know you were there , of course . you must have thought me absurd .
0	there 's no such outfit -- not in the sense he means , what are your plans ? where you going to lie low ? picked a spot yet ?
0	neither she , nor you , nor doane , nor all of you together can talk me out of it ! it was a frame-up !
0	here he is himself , he stood as though lost in thought , and a strange , humiliated , half senseless smile strayed on his lips . he took his cap at last and went quietly out of the room . his ideas were all tangled . he went dreamily through the gateway .
0	brothers ! -- well , hardly ! the boys are the cowboys -- on the ranch , you know . my , but they will give us a welcome ! i reckon they will ride into town to give it , too , in all their war paint . just you wait till you see the boys -- and hear them ! genevieve laughed -- a little more loudly than perhaps she realized .
0	if you do it , i will kill your chief . _i will kill all of you ! _
0	no ! it ought to be in front ! " and so do we ! and so do we " ! replied half a hundred voices confounded in one .
0	you might 's well try to get close to a prickly porcupine , she ' d made up her mind to hate the rest of you girls and she 's going to keep on hating you till the end of time . that 's the sort of a girl amy is .

0	gaberelle ! what is it now ? a hipponocerous ? where is he , miss jane ?
0	sure it 's your lordship has the fine sight to perceive it , " captain blood , i discover greatness in you , " said he .
0	not i , he knows every trail in these woods and in a sprint , tag mosher could leave me hitched to a tree .
0	fulkerson ? why did not you bring him to dinner ?
0	have your will , now a sudden rage filled me against this old rascal . i remembered how he had brought mameena to her death , when he thought that it would serve him , and since then filled the land with stories concerning her and me , which met me whatever way i turned . i remembered that for years he had plotted to bring about the destruction of the zulus , and to further his dark ends , was now engaged in causing a fearful war which would cost the lives of thousands . i remembered that he had trapped me into zululand and then handed me over to cetewayo , separating me from my friends who were in my charge , and for aught i knew , giving them to death . surely the world would be well rid of him .
0	who are ye ? and of what country ? leif brought up his ship and cast anchor . he had the boat out , and himself rowed out to the wreck . " they can do us no harm , whoever they are , " he said ; " but i think they are friends of ours " . some fifteen men were huddled together , and apart from them was a woman in a blue cloak , with a man lying beside her , his head on her lap , and a cloth over his face . she did not move as the boat drew in , but all the others came scrambling down the shelf to the water 's edge .
0	help ! help ! do not you see that i ' m drowning ? oh ! oh ! help ! help !

0	you young scalawags , what are you trying to do ? have some fun with me ? i want to tell you this is no place nor time for fun . i want to get out of here .
0	hoh ! that 's the ozziest thing i have heard since i landed in the silver islands . tappy , my boy , i believe we are going to be friends ! but let 's forget the past and think of the present !
0	your husband ! then , by the living god , he or i shall never leave this place alive .
0	they will find out where we are in three days , will not they ? _i_ say let 's stay here . _i_ say let 's be too proud to send for help .
0	anyone left up there ? plaster , furniture , rafters and men poured down in a mass . the force of the explosion had literally torn the ceiling to pieces and , the supports gone , it collapsed at once .

0	not after you have come right out once and said the wrong thing , i ' m afraid you will have to use your indirect influence on him , mrs . remington .
0	fine , they had been laughing over their early morning snack , now ilya simonov looked at her approvingly . " see here , " he said . " we must do this again " .
0	hepsey ! " nope " !
0	if she wants to write uncle hogan , let her write ! i ' m going to quit bothering them right here and now ; and what 's more , i ' m going to own up , too .
0	no , i am not crying at all , " i love your eyes , " he said . " anyone would love your eyes , aunt betty . but what is the matter with them ? you are not crying at all , but -- oh ! what is the matter " ?
0	i ' m game for anything , my dear fellow , so long as i have you by my side , when you ' re tired , i will promise to take you away . shall we call it arranged ?
0	not even your hats ? " never mind a man " ! i snapped . " never mind anything " !
0	in with it ! in with it ! dash through like a trump .
0	what , man ? five ? she will never see eight the longest day she lives .
0	come on , mr . kinzer , let 's put for the village . we will starve here .
0	hi , hi ! you young rascals ! what do you mean by such conduct ?
0	yes -- if i had quite done with you . it seems she likes clear outlines ; she has a passion for definitions .
0	if la pompadour could hear you , she would understand why i prefer the live amusing lion to the dead dog . when you are gone , i shall be inconsolable . i am a born inquisitor . " so much so , " rejoined i , " as to be intrusive " .
0	oh , mother ! sha not we get to grandmother 's for christmas ?
0	thanks , " maybe she will ask you , " she called back , growing more courageous as the distance between them widened . " i will ask her " .
0	mr . whitney bobbed up in the very nick of time , did not he ? " that was slavery , son , " declared captain dillingham . " do you wonder that abraham lincoln thought it would be worth even a war to rid this country of such an evil ? understand , i am not condemning all slave owners . undoubtedly there were kind and humane ones just as there are to this day employers who are fair with their help . but urged on by commercial greed the temptation of the planters was to force the slaves to do more than was right , and as a result a great deal of cruelty was practiced . had the primitive method of picking cotton by hand continued it is probable that slavery might have died a natural death without recourse to war , for many of the southerners were reaching a point where the returns from cotton and tobacco were not sufficient to feed the army of slaves that swarmed over the plantations . to use a common phrase the slaves were eating their heads off . it was just at this juncture , however , that eli whitney came along with his cotton gin and in a twinkling the south became revolutionized and the problem of the legion of idle , profitless slaves was settled . they would now be idle and profitless no longer . vast quantities of cotton could henceforth be planted and the negroes could cultivate and gather it . with eli whitney 's gin to do the slow and hindering part of the process cotton-raising could be made a paying industry " .
0	oh , there are enough of us to shout if we see bears , we have to hurry , and we will be glad to explore .
0	you will enter that resolution in the minutes of the meeting , then she turned upon her secretary without the least sympathy or kindliness in her manner .
0	jump to one side , walt , jump , for god 's sake , jump . it 's going to strike .
0	it was this way , ned , dragging his blanket after him , had started to run about , not knowing which way to turn nor what had occurred . in the meantime the guide and tad had started in the direction from which the yells had seemed to come .
0	no , no ! i want to play with ut .
0	and what has given rise to this ? the hellenic love of beauty in form , which , in the eye of a greek , is superior to every thing else . he cannot separate the body from the soul , because he holds it to be the most glorious of formed things , and indeed , believes that a beautiful spirit must necessarily inhabit a beautiful body . their gods , therefore , are only elevated human beings , but we adore an unseen power working in nature and in ourselves . the animal takes its place between ourselves and nature ; its actions are guided , not , like our own , by the letter , but by the eternal laws of nature , which owe their origin to the deity , while the letter is a device of man 's own mind . and then , too , where amongst ourselves do we find so earnest a longing and endeavor to gain freedom , the highest good , as among the animals ? where such a regular and well-balanced life from generation to generation , without instruction or precept ? " here is the place : ' she took her own life , and died calling down a heavy curse on thee and thine . the poor , exiled , scorned and plundered oculist nebenchari in babylon sends thee this intelligence to egypt . it is as true as his own hatred of thee end_sentence_quote listen to these words , psamtik , and remember how on his dying bed thy father told thee that , for every drachm of pleasure purchased on earth by wrong-doing , the dying bed will be burdened by a talent 's weight of remorse . fearful misery is coming on egypt for nitetis ' sake . cambyses is preparing to make war on us . he will sweep down on egypt like a scorching wind from the desert . much , which i have staked my nightly sleep and the very marrow of my existence to bring into existence , will be annihilated . still i have not lived in vain . for forty years i have been the careful father and benefactor of a great nation . children and children 's children will speak of amasis as a great , wise and humane king ; they will read my name on the great works which i have built in sais and thebes , and will praise the greatness of my power . neither shall i be condemned by osiris and the forty-two judges of the nether world ; the goddess of truth , who holds the balances , will find that my good deeds outweigh my bad " . -- here the king sighed deeply and remained silent for some time . then , looking tenderly at his wife , he said : " ladice , thou hast been a faithful , virtuous wife to me . for this i thank thee , and ask thy forgiveness for much . we have often misunderstood one another . indeed it was easier for me to accustom myself to the greek modes of thought , than for a greek to understand our egyptian ideas . thou know ' st my love of greek art , -- thou know ' st how i enjoyed the society of thy friend pythagoras , who was thoroughly initiated in all that we believe and know , and adopted much from us . he comprehended the deep wisdom which lies in the doctrines that i reverence most , and he took care not to speak lightly of truths which our priests are perhaps too careful to hide from the people ; for though the many bow down before that which they cannot understand , they would be raised and upheld by those very truths , if explained to them . to a greek mind our worship of animals presents the greatest difficulty , but to my own the worship of the creator in his creatures seems more just and more worthy of a human being , than the worship of his likeness in stone . the greek deities are moreover subject to every human infirmity ; indeed i should have made my queen very unhappy by living in the same manner as her great god zeus " .
0	you can not judge about yourself . but all this excitement -- and studying -- and thinking -- and god knows what -- you ' re not at all the woman i came abroad with . susan could not see it . " i ' m just the same , " she insisted .
0	poof ! that is secondary , and a problem which i leave to the superior mind of _herr hauptmann_ -- and the high command . " ach , yes ! if you are successful , and return within your scheduled time , how will this operative , held at montfaucon , make a satisfactory explanation to the americans regarding his long absence " ?
0	i mean i ' m going to experiment some more with fire-extinguishing chemicals , if you want to --
0	she lives in another state , some four hundred miles from here , mr . page , i advise that you find the boy , first . there is not any real doubt as to his being your son . you had better wait for further proofs until after you have found the boy -- who , according to all accounts , stands badly in need of a real father just now .
0	the most uncommon of qualities , my dear , sit down , children . i must see to mr . carter , who is lost by the porti re and will never be discovered unless i rescue him .
0	while you ' re about it , get in the skysails and royals ! and make a decent job of the gasketing !
0	i do not know enough italian to carry me very far , perhaps between two and three hundred useful words , and some of the parts of a few verbs . let me see just what you thought you were ordering .
0	it must have happened before i can remember , then , she paused , startled at the impossible thought .
0	that 's enough , you ' re keeping the king waiting . get back to your chair and sit there until i come back .
0	the tree is the indian 's friend , mademoiselle . now it is a pine tree that we need . the guards will tell me of one . " but it will leak , m ' sieu " .

0	no matter , we ' re always glad to know that we ' re remembered by nice people .
0	oh , a clean conscience , i suppose , sir terence 's brow darkened . his face was turned away from his secretary . " how can a man be confident of that " ? he wondered .
0	i think they will do as we tell them , but we will get word to-morrow about dutchess and steuben . then we shall know better how the land lies , and can talk plainer .
0	haw , haw , haw ! and are you sure that you give it up as a man would ?
0	you get out , at once . d ' ye hear me ?
0	yes , twice ten , " twenty " ! mused winter .
0	i suppose i _do_ keep track of the fellow , people compare us constantly . we started about the same time , and it rankles to hear of his making a lucky strike just when i have had a tumble . this matter of my backing warner when i went to augusta they told me they had met with more bad luck , and if i did not advance fresh funds they would have to go under . it was the biggest risk i ever took , but i took it . i raised the money on my street-railway bonds . for a day or so afterward i was hopeful , but they quit writing and would not answer my wires . my lawyer in augusta wrote me that they were all three on the verge of suicide , and if they could not close a certain deal in boston they would go under . that 's what i have been waiting on for the last week , and that 's why i have been crazy . but it is all right now -- all right . i ' m safe , and i made money , too -- money that delbridge would like to have .
0	i should hurry her up , " i have not , my dear boy , the least idea " .
0	i do not suspect her , " as you wish , my dear fellow , " said my merry , easy-going friend . " i merely wish to point out the utter folly of all this suspicion " .
0	maybe i am , but we will get him off anyway , what 's the most offensive is not their lying -- one can always forgive lying -- lying is a delightful thing , for it leads to truth -- what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying . i respect porfiry , but . what threw them out at first ? the door was locked , and when they came back with the porter it was open . so it followed that koch and pestryakov were the murderers -- that was their logic !
0	come , come ! i ' m not a man of leisure like you . i must catch the next salmon-colored omnibus .
0	and i am the police ! cassy nodded . " i had to hide it and smuggle it out without his knowing it . he thinks it stolen . if he knew , he would kill me . as it is , he has gone crazy . to quiet him , i said i would go to the police " .
0	judith 's straight because she 's that kind of a girl . why do not you watch your dad instead of jude ? douglas shrugged his shoulders and replied , " judith 's straight . i have kept her so " .
0	both , it is a land of many surprises .
0	i tell you i ' m invincible , in three days australia will be a ruin , a depopulated desert . in a week , all southern asia , in three weeks europe , in two months america .
0	well , -- i ' m going anyway . say , phil ! i have not only got the keys to the o . k . warehouse , but i have keys that fit brenchfield 's and the pioneer traders ' as well . " what 's the good of worrying over a thing like that to-night , jim ? let 's forget it and have a good time " .
0	you never know your friends till you get a gun-hole in your stomach , murray 's more of a sport than you guessed . he certainly do not unroll easy .
0	m , emily , what are you doing ?
0	the accursed brute ! yes , i did it . i wish i had burned out his entrails .
0	i do not know how i come to do that . i never did before . chuck was fitting his oars in the oarlocks . she stood on the landing looking down at him . his hat was off . his hair seemed blonder than ever against the rich tan of his face . his neck muscles swelled a little as he bent . tessie felt a great longing to bury her face in the warm red skin . he straightened with a sigh and smiled at her . " i will be ready in a minute " . he took off his coat and turned his khaki shirt in at the throat , so that you saw the white line of his untanned chest in strange contrast to his sun-burned throat . a feeling of giddy faintness surged over tessie . she stepped blindly into the boat and would have fallen if chuck 's hard , firm grip had not steadied her . " whoa , there ! do not you know how to step into a boat ? there . walk along the middle " .
0	the romans ! the romans ! the romans ! the head of our village quarrelled with the tax-gatherers , and refused to pay his dues to c sar . so the soldiers came a week ago and slaughtered nearly all of us , and took such sheep and cattle as they could find , and with them many of the young folk , to be sold as slaves , so that the rest are left empty and desolate . such are the things that chance in this unhappy land . but , woman , who are you ?
0	oh , well , i might discuss a three-legged critter with you -- once .
0	i ' m no prude , but i could not see this coming , nobody did . all i could do was to break free before my self-respect was absolutely gone !
0	hurrah ! in the arctics at last !
0	i ' m really going this time , it will not make any difference if you bring out a dozen packages , jimmy .
0	hooroo ! that 's the best word i have heard for a long time . and i shall settle down as yer honor 's butler , and look after the grand house , and see that you ' re comfortable .
0	my dear boy , i can introduce you in new york studios to many distinguished gentlemen who would feel that their heads had been shorn if they let their locks get as short as yours . in new york , you might stroll along broadway garbed in turban and a _burnouse_ without greatly exciting anybody . i think my own hair is as long as yours .
0	billy , the fat boy ! come , let 's get on the job !
0	oh , i would not put it quite so strongly as that , however , i guess he will get the cold all right .
0	yes , but here come some fellows who are not ! " we ' re friends of yours " ! called bud , waving his hat in the joy at finding his lost stock .
0	good-by , moran ! good-by , good-by , moran ! you were not for me -- not for me ! the ocean is calling for you , dear ; do not you hear him ? do not you hear him ? good-by , good-by , good-by !
0	it is nothing ! by the horns of satan ! it is nothing . a flesh wound , and like a fool i gave back before it . after him ! in there ! kill ! kill !
0	i sincerely hope you do , too , " then i hope we win " .
0	he says he 's sold his tax claim , for one hundred dollars -- to blount . and then he turns around and says his father will buy my stock for ten cents a share in cash . but he will not lend me the money to pay my note to blount and get my paymaster stock back .
0	got her off all right ! nobody hurt !
0	of course it was , did you only just guess that ? father being only a man , thought that it would make you feel among friends to tell you who we were . he did not think of me at all . but mother knew what i meant , and so i had my way . i could never have looked you in the face if you had known who i was . it would have been forcing myself on you quite too boldly . i am afraid you think i did that to-day , as it was . i am sure i did not mean to , for i know girls were expected to hide their feelings in your day , and i was dreadfully afraid of shocking you . ah me , how hard it must have been for them to have always had to conceal their love like a fault . why did they think it such a shame to love any one till they had been given permission ? it is so odd to think of waiting for permission to fall in love . was it because men in those days were angry when girls loved them ? that is not the way women would feel , i am sure , or men either , i think , now . i do not understand it at all . that will be one of the curious things about the women of those days that you will have to explain to me . i do not believe edith bartlett was so foolish as the others .
0	yes , i repeat it ! the moment you got me , you declared that all children were horrid little insects , and that someone ought to sprinkle bug-powder on them .
0	quite , when do we start ?
0	that 's all right , so can i .
0	swear to it ? " heriot walkingshaw , " he replied .
0	if you do not like the way i did it , you may get some one else , " what was the matter with you to-night , maggie " ? he demanded . " you did not play up to your usual form " .
0	no more ! you have heard what i had to say ; that is enough . now go !
0	and you think half truths are dangerous ? " you need not , " she came back at me -- spunky little thing . " it is not worth thanking anybody for . it 's only a partial fact " .
0	devil take it ! have so many brave fellows eaten lead and drunk salt water for the sake of an empty box , full of rats ? you are a cheat , captain . what had you to defend in this ship ?
0	why , of course , how could i be mistaken ? i have the paper over at the house . i will send marie over with it when i get back . you look very sweet in your picture .
0	mr . moderator , i want to make a motion . we have all heard the big talk that 's been made . all right , then ! i move you , sir , that captain cyrus whittaker be appointed a committee of one to go to washin ' ton , if he wants to , or anywheres else , and see that we get the appropriation . and if we do not get it the blame 's his ! there , now !
0	yes , killers ! do i have to draw you a picture ? they shot my son down in his bed .
0	you can kill me , but you will find it hard work !
0	well , we are ready to act , " you hear that , do you . he has confessed , " said the spokesman to his son who was the reporter of the world-wide news agency that was to give to the reading public an account of the affair .
0	like it ? well , i knew you ' d understand what it meant . mother thinks it 's a little too rowdy-looking . her idea is black broadcloth frock-coat and doeskin trousers for a gentleman , you know . couple of ladies here , somewhere , i ' d like to introduce you to . came over with me from the depot last night . very nice people , and i ' d like to make it pleasant for them -- get up something -- go somewhere -- and when you see their style you can judge what it had better be . mrs . vostrand and her daughter .
0	i drink to our deliverance ! loiseau , fairly in his element , rose to his feet , holding aloft a glass of champagne .
0	what he did to him was plenty , i guess that 's one position we do not need to worry about any longer . and i ' m feeling pretty good , too , about trent and henderson . they worked together at quarter and center like a pair of shears . axtell tackled like a tiger , and if he keeps it up , we can count on him as a fixture . and drake , too , did some dandy work at end . did you see the way he got down under wilson 's punts ? johnny-on-the-spot , every time the ball came down .
0	the only one original , he 's come here to make studies of eastern women . a rare old time he will have among them , i daresay ! he 's not famous for character . he ought to paint the princess ziska .
0	catch him ! it 's a man ! the lad 's feet struck the ground , his body plunged forward and he fell sprawling at the very feet of the men he was seeking to get away from .
0	ha , ha , ha ! me , too , juz de sem lag you ! _attendez_ ; wait .
0	she shows no colours , at that moment the captain came on deck .
0	yes . just put ' em back where they were -- or else up in the attic -- anywhere you want to . " these old letters you had in the bottom drawer , were not they some papa wrote you before you were married " ?
0	no you do not , you must climb out by the futtock shrouds , as every proper sailor does .
0	but then it will be too late , do not you understand ? you have got to let us go now , at once .
0	i had a date to view the scenery up the chagres river , " i am sure he has , " said tommy . " he has been active all day , with half a dozen men going and coming under his orders . he missed you this afternoon " .
0	_and_ , women .
0	ho , ho , you shall be my lackey , -- the chief messenger , hat in hand , begging medicines for me .
0	we might take a vote , and see how we stand on it , " then h-h-how are we agoin ' to decide w-w-what it was " ?
0	farewell , son of hakon ! i would that i too were sailing to the southern lands . spare not , estein ; fire and sword in england , sword and fire in valland !
0	o , come , come ! why , man , you speak the dialect he uses in his answers ; you can hear him up the stairs . so own it . we sha ' not hurt ye . there he 's speaking now ! his syllables are those you sound yourself when you are talking unawares , as this pretty girl declares .
0	thank you ; i will , young man , " will you join us and have some supper " ? asked tad politely , walking out to greet the stranger .
0	run , little master ! run for your life ; make for the bridge -- for the bridge !
0	that was not hard . her sun tan and the condition of her feet proved she was a practicing nudist . no betan girl ever practices nudism to my knowledge . besides , the i.d. tattoo under her left arm and the v on her hip are no marks of our culture . then there was another thing -- the serological analysis revealed no gerontal antibodies . she had never received an injection of longevity compound in her life . this might occur , but it 's highly improbable . the evidence indicates that she 's extra-betan . " but how did you deduce she was not from a betan colony " ? kennon asked .
0	how can you ask , as if you did not know it yourself . self-knowledge should be our first aim ! the ancient philosophers were wise to have inscribed over the entrances to their temples , ' know thyself , ' in order to remind all approaching , to examine themselves before they entered the halls of the gods . is not the human heart equally a temple ? only the demons and the gods strive together therein , unfortunately . to drive the former out , and give place to the latter , should be our aim ; and when once purified , and room is given for good deeds and great achievements , we shall not rest satisfied simply to conquer , but rise with gladness to build altars upon those places which we have freed from the demons ; for that , we must steadily keep in view truth and reality , and not hide them with a black veil , or array them in party-colored rags . our ideas must be clear about the consequences of things , that we may not be like those foolish men who drink wine every evening and complain of headache every morning , resorting to preventives . " what is the aim that we should strive for " ? asked moritz , his whole being suddenly changing , and his manner expressing the greatest depression and sadness .
0	oh , do not _speak_ of returning our money , we really ought to pay you _more_ .
0	look out ! look out , or you will run over my child !
0	let ' er go , before bob could offer any resistance or make any protest he had been jubilantly seized and dumped down on the hide .
0	not altogether for that purpose . but i want to consult you , lady mary , about the advisability of troubling lady ellen treffinger in the matter . it seems scarcely legitimate to go on without asking her to give some sort of grace to my proceedings , yet i feared the whole subject might be painful to her . i shall rely wholly upon your discretion . lady mary laughed her hoarse , baritone laugh . " bravo ! and you have come to me for inspiration for your panegyric " ?
0	keep on thinking about that book , it sounded good advice .
0	antoine , if there 's an accident , i will shoot you through the head , but instead of slacking his pace the coach was whirled along as before ; if there was any change , it was for greater velocity than before .
0	it 's impossible ! father 's the very soul of honor .
0	smite on , smite on and fear not .
0	show it to us now ! " in my country they say i am like papa . in fact , i have his portrait in the trunk and i will show it to you " .
0	never ! she shall accompany me to a new home , which is not under the shadow of your accursed british flag .
0	thank you , as usual , you disarm me on the verge of combat . i had nerved myself for ridicule .
0	say , looky here , council , you can not do this . i never saw y ' see , jane 's married off lately , an ' ike 's away a good ' eal , so we will be darn glad t ' have y ' stop with us this winter . nex ' spring we will see if y ' can not git a start agin " . and he chirruped to the team , which sprang forward with the rumbling , clattering wagon .
0	this is the result of the idea you fellows gave me when you spoke of capturing scalps the other evening , select your suits , gentlemen , and proceed to make up .
0	i think you are , the young man kept quiet and answered : " my name is upsydoun " .
0	while i grew up . i and the others like myself . and while the world outside changed . your friend richard wade was right , you know . he guessed a great deal of the truth . leffingwell and manschoff and the rest of their associates deliberately set out to assemble a select group of nonconformists -- men of specialized talents and outlooks . there were over three hundred of you at stark falls . richard wade knew why .
0	what are you ' on ' this morning , condy ? " huh ! no , it all goes for theatre tickets , and flowers , and boxes of candy for a certain girl i know . but " -- and he glared at her significantly -- " no more foolishness " .
0	the bonnet ! does the boat wear a bonnet ?
0	a man who has served for twenty years will not be an indifferent workman sir . timmins ' accounts are exemplary . " i shall be at stormly this week and will see if timmins wishes to retire or not . you have no fault to find with him as a gardener , i suppose " ?
0	well ! what is it ? " well , clara " ! whined lil , mournfully .
0	perhaps we had better not try it again , she did not appear to see the hand he offered , but got to her feet without help and walked quickly away with norbert , who proceeded to live up to the character he had given himself .
0	ha , ha , ha ! that 's a good story . you never fight any one . what a fib !
0	stop ! stop ! stop ! i waved my hands wildly above my head .
0	and say you so , francis ? belike it be no unpleasant duty . but there , child ! ' tis little of entertainment thou hast , so make merry with the lad for i fear that he will not remain here long .
0	at him ! pull down the weapons from the walls ! the fool is mad !
0	that is very true , breckon laughed . " do not burlesque it ! besides , i have not promised anything " .
0	go as far as you like , they have used up their time limit in scolding like old women . perez , i wait for the guns .
0	the cowards ! " the greeks are on the run " ! i said . " they are headed southward ! they have got their boys together , and have abandoned the cattle ! they ' re off with their tent and belongings due south " !
0	lady gwendoline ? " who is she " ? she asked , without looking up . " lady gwendoline , of course " .
0	what you want to do is stay at home and dig taters , a biled collar would defeat any one of yeh , dead sure .
0	bertie 's the image of his mother . i shall have a first-rate band and second-rate music . lady nora sighed . " but how uncomfortable ! well , then , you ' d better have the blue hungarians and the red ones too . those who do not like the one can listen to the other " .
0	oh , oh , do say it , mamma !
0	for pity 's sake , do not get flowery ! " oh , you ' re so literal ! it 's only for the sake of the metaphor . may not i talk about ' the busy bee ' and ' the shining hour ' " ?
0	naughty old wagon , she drove along recklessly , as was her custom , and when half way to the theatre narrowly missed running down a small , sturdy figure that was marching across the street .
0	ideal ! what is ideal ? " yes , but the new illusions will not wear so well ; and in marriage you want illusions that will last . no ; you need not talk to me . it 's all very well , but it is not ideal " .
0	brute , you are hurting me ! but he was too quick for her , and his fingers closed like a vice on her wrist .
0	we do not understand french , and so we can not tell what time it is , " for less than an hour , " added grossbeck , gloomily .
0	lie quiet and keep silence ! he was , however , a man of different stuff he gave a loud shout and grappled with boldero , who struck him a heavy blow with his fist in the face , and this for a moment silenced him ; but the alarm being given , the superintendent and the two men struggled to their feet , only however to fall prostrate as soon as they tried to walk .
0	but it will never hurt us , we have got on famously .
0	i will need some security for that . i do not choose to take your word for it , madame de condillac . " release him , and , in god 's name , go your ways . none shall stay you , " she promised him .
0	give it up ! however , the superintendent has a copy of the letter , and he will know the ropes . we will wait a day , then , if he 's quiescent , it 's up to us .
0	hush , billy ! that 's our master !
0	you ' re not a politician , i see , " i do not care a fig one way or t ' other , " said ambrose . " if any creature is so deluded as to think that a vote does him or her any good , let him have it . he will soon learn better " .
0	because , in love and hate , as well as in reckoning , two and three follow one , as for your wolff , in particular , i will gladly believe , with you , that he can succeed in clearing himself before the judges . but with regard to old eysvogel , who looks as though , if he met our dear lord himself , he would think first which of the two was the richer , your future brother-in-law siebenburg , that disagreeable ' mustache , ' and his poor wife , who sits at home grieving over her dissolute husband -- what gratitude you can expect from such kindred --
0	you ' re a dull old person , have not you discovered that ' tis they who forget us ? and why should not they ? do _we_ remember well ? -- anybody except just us two , i mean , of course .
0	we feel almost as though we had lost a partner in the firm , but i ' m mighty glad for both of you . she was fitted for something a whole lot bigger than wall street .
0	does it bring any more pay ? " that was a pretty good thing for you this afternoon , men , " he commented pleasantly . " it is not often that a rookie gets commended in orders " .
0	i was never more convinced of it , sir , now , i ' m going to bed -- what are you going to do ?
0	ah vestal maiden , i am meanwhile punishing you by withholding from you a great secret which interests us all . no , no , i am not going to tell -- but i beg you my lady wife to take her to task , and teach her to exercise some indulgence so that her future husband may not have too hard a time of it .
0	well , you must make allowances for my then frame of mind , i rather gather from your manner that somebody else has been after the case ; if that is so , you are right to be reticent . still , it is in your hands to settle the matter on the spot . all you have to do is to open the case , and if you fail to find my initials , d.s. , scratched in the left-hand top corner , then i have lost my property and the other fellow has found his .
0	i do not know much . i met him by accident -- he has an interest in some mines , i believe , but he struck me as a remarkably fine type . clever at woodcraft , as handy with the ax and paddle as our professional guide , but when he talked about other things he seemed to know a good deal more than i do . after all , that 's not surprising . but what i liked most was the earnestness of the fellow ; he had a downright way of grappling with things , or explaining them to you . sensible , but direct , not subtle .
0	you do not need to worry . i ' m going to lend them my yacht for a trip . uncle william rubbed his head . " um -- i ' d forgot _her_ , too " .
0	i know it . it is for that very reason i wish her to know . have no fear , monsieur ; her highness will not send you to prison .
0	what are you telling me all this for ? i have no desire to hear it ! i have no desire to ! i do not want your vulgar secrets ! damnation take them ! do not dare to tell me of such vulgar doings ! do you consider that i have not been insulted enough already ? that i am a flunkey whom you can insult without restraint ? is that it ?
0	obo ! " azinte " ! cried harold , as our sable heroine came into view .
0	wages ! stiffy , would you look at what 's askin ' for wages ! go on , man ! you ' re damned lucky if you get a skinful of grub every day . grub comes high up here !
0	what is it , umbopa , son of a fool ? so we sat down under the rocks and groaned , and for one i wished heartily that we had never started on this fool 's errand . as we were sitting there i saw umbopa get up and hobble towards the patch of green , and a few minutes afterwards , to my great astonishment , i perceived that usually very dignified individual dancing and shouting like a maniac , and waving something green . off we all scrambled towards him as fast as our wearied limbs would carry us , hoping that he had found water .
0	i am afraid i cannot claim the credit for that , " it was a fine speech you gave , trevanion , " said another . " by george , that idea of giving a white feather to all the shirkers was just fine . i hear that the basket is nearly empty " .
0	go ahead , snap , tie up your lady love . what a tame little wife she 's going to make you ! tie her up , but do it without hurting her . " who says no " ? hissed the mormon , with snapping teeth . as he wheeled upon them his colt seemed to leap forward , and suddenly quivered at arm ' s-length , gleaming in the ruddy fire-rays .
0	stop ! stop !
0	passed ! fit as fiddles !
0	who did you say was here -- oh , it 's you , rankin ; come in , come in . " it 's four years old , and never been touched , not even the sleeves , " said the other deprecatingly .
0	follow me , men , make all the noise you can .
0	you ! not that i do not admire your courage . i do . but the other day , now , when you lost a tire and went into the ditch --
0	put it , ' well done , good and faithful servant , ' " ah , to think of it , only to think of it ! -- the poor old faithful creature . for she was so faithful . would you believe it , she had been a servant in that selfsame house and that selfsame family for twenty seven years come christmas , and never a cross word and never a lick ! and , oh , to think she should meet such a death at last ! -- a-sitting over the red hot stove at three o ' clock in the morning and went to sleep and fell on it and was actually roasted ! not just frizzled up a bit , but literally roasted to a crisp ! poor faithful creature , how she was cooked ! i am but a poor woman , but even if i have to scrimp to do it , i will put up a tombstone over that lone sufferer 's grave -- and mr . riley if you would have the goodness to think up a little epitaph to put on it which would sort of describe the awful way in which she met her -- "
0	if they want a shilling for each , it will soon run away with one 's pocket-money , " you will do " ! whispered lennie chapman , who had watched over gipsy 's introduction with anxious interest . " if helen roper 's spoken to you , you ' re sure to get on . you will join the guilds , of course ? there 's the dramatic as well , and the musical , and the athletic " .
0	ah ! ah ! ' concerning this one , i do consider her to be very , very holy , as during her lifetime she gave a fine example of humility .

0	back ! back , and let me git a shot at the critter !
0	the british girls , berenice , say they wish the romans would not be always fighting . " i should like to go into the woods , " the girl said earnestly , " i am tired of this town . my father says he will take me with him some day when he goes west , but so far i have seen nothing except this town and verulamium , and the country was all just as it is here , fields and cultivation . we could see the forests in the distance , but that was all . my father says , that if we went west , we should travel for miles through the forest and should sleep in tents , but that we cannot do it till everything is quiet and peaceful . oh , beric ! i do wish the britons would not be always fighting " .
0	stand aside ! jim 's hand flew to his belt and the big revolver was jerked out in a trice . he pushed it into the stomach of the foremost man , and caused that worthy to shiver with terror . the latter backed away , whilst his friends hunted for firearms .
0	yes , and you will soon discover that it is something more than a demonstration .
0	i ' d look a fine fish letting of him go now , after what 's passed between us ! ye mind what he ' d do the minute he got his paws free . reddy , if ye do not shut yer trap i will drill ye , that 's what .
0	i guess so , yes , i did not know i was going to though . it just happened .

0	oh ! a-h-h ! hit ! ashwell , too , was left-handed ; he , too , was extremely hard to pitch to ; and if he had a weakness that any of us ever discovered , it was a slow curve and change of pace . but i doubted if vane would dare to use slow balls to ash at that critical moment . i had yet to learn something of vane . he gave ash a slow , wide-sweeping sidewheeler , that curved round over the plate . ash always took a strike , so this did not matter . then vane used his deceptive change of pace , sending up a curve that just missed ash 's bat as he swung .
0	twenty-seven ! " going , going , going -- at twent -- ty -- four dollars and a half , gen -- "
0	was it so bad as that ? i shall begin to respect myself . he and dunham went out into the cabin , where they found captain jenness pacing to and fro . " well , sir , " he said , taking staniford 's hand , and crossing his right with his left , so as to include dunham in his congratulations , " you ought to have been a sailor " ! then he added , as if the unqualified praise might seem fulsome , " but if you ' d been a sailor , you would not have tried a thing like that . you ' d have had more sense . the chances were ten to one against you " .
0	why , yes , the only truth is that richard is afraid .
0	you can not pay anything here , we do not charge shipwrecked people anything .
0	thought ! ye thought ! what d ' ye mean ? speak out , and do not be thinkin ' . thought ? what the devil 's that ? " a thowt i see ' un , then , " muttered the bantam , trying a middle course .
0	if he did , he did not let the police know about it , if there ' d been a warrant against you , dock , the orders would have been read to the night watch at the station house . did you run from the boys because you thought there was a warrant against you ?
0	well -- as much as it 's anybody 's . i come here to sketch occasionally . " is this your house " ? he inquired .
0	empty -- an empty keg ? " no , sir -- no , " said billy . " there 's not a grain of powder in the keg " .
0	i ' m not so sure that it is not , it 's the dinner-table that rules in england . we settle everything round a dinner-table .
0	you probably can , he does not live far from barracks , and that 's where you are going . i have got orders to have you ready to move in the morning .
0	something like it , it was just all i could do to hold it . but the _souffle was_ worth it , was not it ? i must tell miss de lisle .
0	m . le comte surely owes me so much , " if mme . du chatelet has given me a correct idea of the state of affairs , count on me , my dear lucien , " said the prefect , preparing to hurry after his wife . she was going away without him , after the paris fashion . " your brother-in-law may consider that his troubles are at an end , " he added as he went .
0	yes , yes , yes . certainly she does , everybody knows that .
0	only a tiny bit ; and that 's better than a fishy handshake . luckily , i left my sharpest rings in new york . and , oh , the gold bag you saved is gone forever ! i have just had it stolen . she put out her hand , and he radiated joy as he took it . happiness was becoming to nick . an all too cordial grip he gave , then loosened his grasp in a fright ; " i hope i have not hurt you " ! he exclaimed , horrified .
0	and you suffered it ! " he did her no violence save to kiss her , while i was by " .
0	do you hear ? i want you to turn him off .
0	that is precisely the matter which has brought me to lisbon . " take steps to discover the spy whose existence is disclosed by this event " .
0	are not you ashamed ? but yann clearly knew that that was not true , and that she was a very respectable old woman , who only drank water .

0	there is no need of that at all . i am willing that they should go , only you can hardly blame me for hesitating a little , as this will be the first time either one has been away from home over night ; and besides , peace is such a blunderbus , i rather dread to let her go anywhere for fear she will get into trouble . " that is easily remedied . i have some little cousins who are sure to have dresses that will fit . it is to be rather a dress-parade , i must admit , but you need not worry on that account . mamma knows how to fix them up in sara 's and marion 's clothes . we must have them . mr . strong will give us a good recommend , i know " .

0	nobody cares for ancestors any more . not since people began to hunt them up . you can find anything if you look for it , aunt maude . and most of the crests are bought or borrowed so that if one really belongs to you , you do not like to speak of it , any more than to tell that you are a lady or take a daily bath . when aunt maude went to the meeting of her favorite organization , she wore always black velvet which showed the rounds of her shoulders , point lace in a deep bertha , the family diamonds , and all of her badges . the badges had bars and jewels , and the effect was imposing .

0	that 's a good one -- whistling for _snow_ ! we will tell the fellows !
0	just so , -- and therefore what do you do ? you goes and lays yourself out for government ! i ' m not saying as how you ' re anyways wrong . a man has to live . you has winning ways , and a good physiognomy of your own , and are as big as a life-guardsman . very well ; you makes your way with the big wigs , lords and earls and them like , and you gets returned for a rotten borough ; -- you will excuse me , but that 's about it , ai not it ? -- and then you goes in for government ! a man may have a mission to govern , such as washington and cromwell and the like o ' them . but when i hears of mr . fitzgibbon a-governing , why then i says , -- d -- n it all .
0	h ' m . i hope there 's something in that . i hope there is . i have never paid much attention to thinkright 's little pilgrimages among his rose-colored clouds , but perhaps it might be to my advantage to do so ; perhaps it might . the fact is , girl , -- i ' m sorry to confess it because i know it will be unwelcome news , but -- i ' m your uncle calvin .

0	up , charlot ! awake ! he stood a moment at his casement , looking out into the empty courtyard . from a leaden sky the rain was descending in sheets , and the gargoyle at the end of the eaves overhead was discharging a steady column of water into the yard . caron shivered with the cold of that gloomy february morning , and turned away from the window . a few moments later he was in tardivet 's bedchamber , vigorously shaking the sleeping captain .

0	forward , there ! steam was up on the wetumpka , and we cast off the fasts from the landing-pier . all the party were on the main deck , looking down into the deep , clear water . the young ladies screamed forth their delight at the reflected objects in the water , and at the fish on the bottom , eighty feet down . we entered the run , and in another hour we were stemming the gentle tide of the ocklawaha again . the stream was somewhat narrower than below the spring , from which it receives a large volume of water .

0	stop ! just stop before you say something you will be sorry for . of course , you hate each other . it beats me , anyhow , why two people who get married always want to get away by themselves until they ' re so sick of each other that they do not get over it the rest of their lives . the only sensible honeymoon i ever heard of was when one of the chambermaids here married a farmer in the neighborhood . it was harvest and he could not leave , so she went alone to see her folks and she said it beat having him along all hollow .
0	i knew you were going to scold me , annie nodded acquiescence .

0	you look like some worn and weary brother , pulling hard against the stream , whilst engaged in these not unpleasing studies , i caught a momentary glimpse of something , ten yards away to the left , which seemed to be moving slowly against the wind . the volume of flying dust was , of course , far from uniform in density ; and presently i caught sight of the object again . it was a man , creeping slowly and painfully across the stubbly knobs of cotton-bush on his hands and knees . i hailed him in a voice that took the skin off my throat , but another glimpse showed him still travelling ; his head bent almost to the ground . i rose carefully to my feet , facing the shower , but only to be hurled down on top of the faithful pup , and savagely snapped at . then i went like a quadruped till i reached the wayfarer , and caught him by the ankle . he looked round ; i beckoned , and crept back to my former seat , whilst he followed close behind . then a bearded , haggard , resolute face , framed by an old hat tied down over the ears , confronted me .

0	call your dog off , sergeant , or he will be killed , sourdough had aged a good deal during the past year , but despite the twist in his near fore leg , which caused him to limp slightly , the old dog still held his own as despotic ruler of all the dogs in that locality . but for a good many years he had done no work of any kind , neither had he had any very serious fighting or come in contact with northland dogs . his swiftest movements would have seemed clumsy and slow to the working husky , inured to the comparative wildness of trace life in the north . but his morose arrogance and ferocity had suffered no diminution , as was shown by the fact that he flew straight for jan 's throat directly he set eyes on the big hound .

0	legislatur ' through ? at last , toward the end of june , it was noised about that the great man was coming home for a few days . one beautiful afternoon william wetherell stood on the platform of the store , looking off at coniston , talking to moses hatch -- young moses , who is father of six children now and has forgotten cynthia ware . old moses sleeps on the hillside , let us hope in the peace of the orthodox and the righteous . a cloud of dust arose above the road to the southward , and out of it came a country wagon drawn by a fat horse , and in the wagon the strangest couple wetherell had ever seen . the little woman who sat retiringly at one end of the seat was all in brilliant colors from bonnet to flounce , like a paroquet , red and green predominating . the man , big in build , large-headed , wore an old-fashioned blue swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons , a stock , and coonskin hat , though it was summer , and the thumping of william wetherell 's heart told him that this was jethro bass . he nodded briefly at moses hatch , who greeted him with genial obsequiousness .

0	rather too much like a standing army controlled by corporation that would be ; and a standing army is a luxury the constitution forbids even to sovereign states . besides , would men enlist in such a service ? " that 's the enormity of the whole business , " broke in mr . allison . " what i wish could be done with our hands would be to have them regularly enlisted for the work , -- so many years unless sooner discharged , -- just like the soldiers , by jove ! then when a man quit work it would be desertion , and when he combined with others to strike it would be mutiny . ah , we ' d have a railway service in this country then that would beat the world " .

0	where 's the girls ? they followed him inside and ranged up against the long bar where of yore a half-dozen nimble bar-keepers found little time to loaf . the great room , ordinarily aroar with life , was still and gloomy as a tomb . there was no rattling of chips , no whirring of ivory balls . roulette and faro tables were like gravestones under their canvas covers . no women 's voices drifted merrily from the dance-room behind . ol ' jim cummings wiped a glass with palsied hands , and kink mitchell scrawled his initials on the dust-covered bar .

0	oh ! hardly that , but one of the duties of a scout is never to just take things for granted . he must be wise enough to make provision against any ordinary happening that might come about . in other words he insures his stock of provisions like a sensible merchant does his goods . he does not expect to have a fire , you know ; but he wants to be sure he will not be ruined if one does come .

0	and a very good best it was , albert , ' tis true that in the skirmish outside aldersgate i might have managed by myself , but in the fleming 's affair and in the tower i should have fared hardly indeed had it not been for your help . i fancy that we have the fleming to thank for this good fortune . you see he had already told the king that we were to accompany him , and perhaps he may have pointed out to him that it might be to the advantage of his mission that we should be made knights . he has great influence with the court , seeing that he has frequently supplied the royal needs with money . first let us visit our good friend sir robert gaiton .
0	wet i am , to be sure , but the fire that burns in my veins will soon dry the stuff . i will , however , gladly eat a little and drink a glass of wine with you . it was a hard fight with the sea-monsters , they seemed to roar in my ears , ' we will have you , we will pull you down ! ' and yet it sounded sweetly ! there is no finer music than when , the sea-monsters come up from the deep and sing their wild songs .

0	i ' m glad i came to this country . i was right . i was right to seek out a land where such healthy principles and theories are in men 's hearty and minds . think of the innumerable slaveries imposed by misplaced reverence ! how well he brought that out , and how true it is . there 's manifestly prodigious force in reverence . if you can get a man to reverence your ideals , he 's your slave . oh , yes , in all the ages the peoples of europe have been diligently taught to avoid reasoning about the shams of monarchy and nobility , been taught to avoid examining them , been taught to reverence them ; and now , as a natural result , to reverence them is second nature . in order to shock them it is sufficient to inject a thought of the opposite kind into their dull minds . for ages , any expression of so-called irreverence from their lips has been sin and crime . the sham and swindle of all this is apparent the moment one reflects that he is himself the only legitimately qualified judge of what is entitled to reverence and what is not . come , i had not thought of that before , but it is true , absolutely true . what right has goethe , what right has arnold , what right has any dictionary , to define the word irreverence for me ? what their ideals are is nothing to me . so long as i reverence my own ideals my whole duty is done , and i commit no profanation if i laugh at theirs . i may scoff at other people 's ideals as much as i want to . it is my right and my privilege . no man has any right to deny it . well , the charge is , that our press has but little of that old world quality , reverence . let us be candidly grateful that it is so . with its limited reverence it at least reveres the things which this nation reveres , as a rule , and that is sufficient : what other people revere is fairly and properly matter of light importance to us . our press does not reverence kings , it does not reverence so called nobilities , it does not reverence established ecclesiastical slaveries , it does not reverence laws which rob a younger son to fatten an elder one , it does not reverence any fraud or sham or infamy , howsoever old or rotten or holy , which sets one citizen above his neighbor by accident of birth : it does not reverence any law or custom , howsoever old or decayed or sacred , which shuts against the best man in the land the best place in the land and the divine right to prove property and go up and occupy it . in the sense of the poet goethe -- that meek idolater of provincial three carat royalty and nobility -- our press is certainly bankrupt in the " thrill of awe " -- otherwise reverence ; reverence for nickel plate and brummagem . let us sincerely hope that this fact will remain a fact forever : for to my mind a discriminating irreverence is the creator and protector of human liberty -- even as the other thing is the creator , nurse , and steadfast protector of all forms of human slavery , bodily and mental .

0	pooh , pooh ! i have no wish for payment , man . to win out in this game is payment enough for me . besides , the police are not allowed to accept money , you know . an officer of the law gets his satisfaction in clearing up a crime and locating the loot . until he can do that his mind is never at peace . this day 's stroke has enabled me to wipe two mysteries that have balked me off my slate and go to bed to-night with at least that many less on my mind .

0	lower away the long-boat ! and now the great evil of not being provided with proper tackling to launch the boats became apparent . one of the quarter-boats was the first to be lowered ; it was full of men . the order was given to lower , and it dropped on the water all right . then the order to unhook the tackle was given . the man at the stern tackle succeeded in unhooking , but the man at the bow failed . the result was fatal and instantaneous . when the ship rose on the next wave , the boat was lifted by the bow out of the water until she hung from the davits , and a terrible cry was uttered as all the men were thrown out of her into the sea . next moment the boat was plunged into the waves , the tackle snapt , and she was swept away .

0	that surprises you ! but i had already traveled through half the empire , and had experienced more than other boys of twice my age . i was , at any rate , still child enough to forget everything else in the brilliant spectacle that unfolded before my eyes . i remember to this day the colored wax statue which represented pertinax so exactly that it might have been himself risen from the grave . and the procession ! it seemed to have no end ; one new thing followed another . all walked past in mourning robes , even the choir of singing boys and men . cilo explained to me who had made the statues of the romans who had served their country , who the artists and scholars were , whose statues and busts were carried by . then came bronze groups of the people of every nation in the empire , in their costumes . cilo told me what they were called , and where they lived ; he then added that one day they would all belong to me ; that i must learn the art of fighting , in case they resisted me , and should require suppressing . also , when they carried the flags of the guilds past , when the horse and foot soldiers , the race-horses from the circus and several other things came by , he continued to explain them . i only remember it now because it made me so happy . the old man spoke to me alone ; he regarded me alone as the future sovereign . he left geta to eat the sweets which his aunts had given him , and when i too wanted some my brother refused to let me have any . then cilo stroked my hair , and said : ' leave him his toys . when you are a man you shall have the whole roman empire for your own , and all the nations i told you of end_sentence_quote geta meanwhile had thought better of it , and pushed some of the sweetmeats toward me . i would not have them , and , when he tried to make me take them , i threw them into the road .

0	come , boy ! bring his rifle , powder , and ball .
0	all the same , i do not want the privilege , a man with a face like that could not reform ; nature would resent such an enormity . and yet you can never tell . physically speaking , my quondam friend hatherly bell has a perfect face .
0	lots of time , it does not really matter when i get to banbury cross . come on !
0	i know , -- to mellow ! how did you like it ?
0	about three miles , but keep on that plank , or you will never live through the rollers . good-bye .
0	that 's quick work , bob , how did you come to land two customers so quickly ?
0	with honour ! to be hung like a forger of bank-notes -- not even to be shot -- and then to be forgotten . forgotten utterly ! this does not happen to be one of those revolutions which men remember .
0	you are as decided and dictatorial as ever , but this time you shall have your way . what will you have -- a bit of chopin or grieg ? here is plenty of music to choose from .
0	never ! i should have to give up my intellect first , i suppose . i ' m not prepared to do _that_ . why , what made you think he would influence me ?
0	i will take the rock to my back , if you will just slide along and make room , i do not hanker for a cigarette , but i do wish i had my kodak .
0	has the conqueror run away with it to bury it ? in pursuance of a determination to which the ladies of brookfield had come , adela , following her sprightly fancy , now gave the lead in affability toward mrs . chump .
0	do you know -- i am rather ? they have been very good to me . " i ' m used to it , " said green , and laughed . " how are you getting on ? enjoying life at the court " ?
0	i know -- i know ! everybody tried to find out what was the matter .
0	you talk like an unpleasant book , " perhaps i read ' em and got ' em by heart . but do not you see that all the fine things i mentioned have to be paid for by increased liability to mental distress , to forms of pain to which coarse natures are , happily , strangers " ?
0	yes , but it was really a difficult task . at first , when i called him ' st . clair ' he would not take the least notice until i ' d spoken two or three times ; and then , when the other boys nudged him , he would look up with such an aggrieved air , as if i ' d called him john or charlie and he could not be expected to know i meant him . so i kept him in after school one night and talked kindly to him . i told him his mother wished me to call him st . clair and i could not go against her wishes . he saw it when it was all explained out . . . he 's really a very reasonable little fellow . . . and he said _i_ could call him st . clair but that he ' d ' lick the stuffing ' out of any of the boys that tried it . of course , i had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language . since then _i_ call him st . clair and the boys call him jake and all goes smoothly . he informs me that he means to be a carpenter , but mrs . donnell says i am to make a college professor out of him .
0	' whither away ? ' of course _was_ what he said ! ' why , i ' m going to find my spruce forest ! ' i told him . ' and i can not wait a moment longer ! is it the big one over beyond the mountain ? ' i implored him . ' or the little grove that the deacon tried to sell you last year ? '
0	daddy 's surprise ! let me open it , mother ?
0	oh , dear ! " i rather wish dick had not been in such an awful rush , " tom admitted slowly . " anyway , we fellows should have gotten out of here and left it to the marshals to have it all their own way . i ' m afraid there is going to be a big fight to-night , and these old woods may be full of humming bullets . and i ' m worried about dick , too , going off as guide to the marshals . there were only eight of the marshals , and , even with four of our fellows , they still have to face nearly twenty of the moonshiners -- and i will wager that the moonshiners are all desperate fighters " .
0	h ' m ! very commendable spirit , is that your case , mr . percival ?
0	one moment more , we must e ' en change garments for the nonce . take mine and scurry home quickly lest the king 's foresters try to put a hole through this lincoln green .
0	everywhere there are boys and girls , unawakened -- if only people would look for them ; and with your knowledge of languages you could do great things with the little foreigners -- turn a bunch of them into good citizens , for example . it was with the wish to make life something more than it was that grace asked roger the next day , " is there any work here in town like yours for the boy -- you see mary has told me about him " .
0	i think i hear the jingle of gold ' in the near future , ' as the yankees say ; and , miss justine , you shall open the way to the veiled rose of delhi for me , while berthe louison tortures this old vetch . place aux dames ! place aux dames ! " you may absolutely depend on me , sir hugh , " heartily answered the visitor , with a fine forgetfulness as to the title . when he rode away , major hawke caught sight of a womanly figure at a window above him , watching his retreat in due state , and there was the flutter of a handkerchief as his carriage drove around the oval . " i wonder if ram lal knows about the jewels . i must buy him out and out , or make berthe louison do it unconsciously for me , " so mused the victorious renegade . " he is afraid of me ! now to dispatch ram lal to allahabad . i must only see berthe louison , at night , in her own bungalow , for my shy old bird would take the alarm were we seen together . what the devil is her game ? i know mine , and i swear that i will soon know hers . i have him guessing now . i must hunt up hardwicke and call on old willoughby to keep up the dumb show . johnstone may watch me -- very likely he will . he is afraid of some coup de theatre " . he drove in a leisurely way back to the club and sported the oak after giving ram lal his last orders .
0	i am afraid your wishes would not go quite as far in this case as they generally do with me . you and miss schuyler can not stay here until i could get a sleigh from allonby 's . " no , " she said . " it was my fault -- and we cannot let you go " .
0	sit down ! access was had into this improvised grotto by means of a narrow opening , through which it was necessary to crawl on one 's hands and knees ; the doctor found some difficulty in entering , and the others followed . supper was soon prepared on the alcohol cooking-stove . the temperature inside was very comfortable ; the wind , which was raging without , could not get in .
0	but , surely , it did do that , if nothing else . having got his wife out of the way , lou sat down on the step and began to whittle . " well , what do folks in new york think of william jennings bryan " ? lou began to bluster , as he always did when he talked politics . " we gave wall street a scare in ninety-six , all right , and we ' re fixing another to hand them . silver was not the only issue , " he nodded mysteriously . " there 's a good many things got to be changed . the west is going to make itself heard " .

0	here , you ! get in here quick ! there 's no time to lose !
0	in which case , you will of course present yourself , may i ask where you intend to pass your time until you leave for the city , sir ?
0	you doubt it , well , wait till you have been here longer . the fact is , any one born in our climate could not live in yours . the king experimented on a man who claimed to have only one lung , but who had two sound ones when he was cut open . well , the king sent him to china , or america , or some such place , and he wheezed himself to death in a week by your clocks . the weather was too fickle for him . our system has been perfected to such an extent that we live four lives to your one , and our fruits and vegetables are a hundred per cent . better than those in other countries .
0	i accept your offer , and i will start downstream this very moment .
0	perhaps the lion or tiger will try for you , what then ?

0	oo , oo , it 's a snake , jehosophat felt disappointed because he was the oldest and had not caught any fish at all . but the afternoon was not gone when he felt a big tug at his line . it took him a long time to pull that fish in . when the hook came out of the water a long wriggly thing was on it .
0	hurrah ! " a uniform " ! repeated several of the boys .
0	and be damned to them ! am i to be ruled by this headstrong boy ? he has beat mr . fairbrother , and shall have no skimmed-milk supervision if i can help it .
0	yes , do you remember the english ex-member of parliament ?
0	well , then , if south braintree vouches for miss viner -- " it 's all the odder because my mother-in-law , since her second marriage , has lived so much in the country that she 's practically lost sight of all her other american friends . besides which , you can see how completely she has identified herself with monsieur de chantelle 's nationality and adopted french habits and prejudices . yet when anything goes wrong she always sends for adelaide painter , who 's more american than the stars and stripes , and might have left south braintree yesterday , if she had not , rather , brought it over with her in her trunk " .
0	i have come , to --
0	is it thy spirit , o my love ? is it thy spirit , o dear , dead love ?
0	i can understand that , i have wanted to beat dolly myself sometimes when she laughed when she was being scolded for something !
0	what 's that ? see here , holmes , i do not want any trouble with you .
0	the miracle does not astonish me , but is it permitted to ask what dark spirit so effectually produced the contrary result , and made a timon of the fair lucilla 's happy husband ?
0	lord , but we ' re virtuous ! i will come for you at a quarter to nine .
0	welcome to ox bow , at first , as your back was turned to me , i took you for one of the men . instantly you faced me i saw the mistake i had made . wo not you be seated ?
0	oh ! mother of god ! i am a miserable woman . will he forgive me ? the poor , innocent man . will he forgive me ? oh , mr . almayer , he is so severe . oh ! help me . . . . i dare not . . . . you do not know what i have done to him . . . . i dare not ! . . . i can not ! . . . god help me !
0	yes , yes , we will do that ! come , come ; let us all go to the minister 's house and ask him to give us back the emperor and the state treasure , and to make peace with bonaparte .
0	there will be wars for forty years on malaita on account of this , but i always fancy old telepasse will never again attempt to rush a plantation .

0	he must be a dandy in a good swift game of poker ! i should not think he ' d be able to make up his mind how to discard . he ' d be a drawback to the game , or i ' m much mistaken .
0	' good-night , ladies -- ' when i began on that they knew it was all up with them --
0	were you afraid the boogaboos would get you ? i was thinking of when i was a small child . i was always afraid of them . i used to race downstairs when i had to go to my room in the dark , unless i could persuade someone to hold my hand all the way there and back .
0	on the left , yonder , where there is a chapel , i think i see --
0	americans ? death to the americans ! death to all foreigners !
0	because why ? because you ai not had no education : what does a rail-sputter like abe know about this government ? judge douglas has worked it all out . he 's smart . let the territories take care of themselves . besides , abe ai not got no dignity . the fust of this week i seen him side-tracked down the road here in a caboose , while doug went by in a special .
0	i declare , that 's the neatest , most military thing i ever saw done ! the soldier is drilled to fair play , and to detestation of cowardice . these young military students passed the word quickly . they left the grounds at once , but formed near by , on a side street near where they learned that barnes and his rough mob lay in ambush .
0	beware , old man ! ' tis a dog that bites !
0	the lord be with you ! what have you done to the child ? anyway , i had everything that was necessary . and there only remained one thing for me to do -- to scale off the cedar wood from the sofa . for this work i selected a very good time , when my mother was in the shop , and my father had gone to lie down and have a nap after dinner . i hid myself in a corner and , with a big nail , i betook myself to my work in good earnest . my father heard , in his sleep , how some one was scraping something . at first he thought there were mice in the house , and he began to make a noise from his bedroom to drive them off -- " kush ! kush " ! i was like dead . my father turned over on the other side and when i heard him snoring again , i went back to my work . suddenly i looked about me . my father was standing and staring at me with curious eyes . it appeared that he could not , on any account , understand what was going on -- what i was doing . then , when he saw the spoiled and torn sofa , he realized what i had done . he pulled me out of the corner by the ear and beat me so much that i fainted away and had to be revived . i actually had to have cold water thrown over me to bring me to life again .
0	si-lence ! here , marines , come on my side . i will cut down the next man who dares to speak . have you got the pistols , mr leigh ?
0	trial be damned ! we have had enough law in this valley . now we ' re after justice .
0	he , he , he ! " expects me " ? again repeated the musketeer .
0	you think ! you know , do not you ? you bought it for her . you made the first payment upon it , did you not ?
0	you have not any illusions about it , have you ? " i fancy that when we have been home for a time , we may feel somewhat bitter if we find that our pedestals are knocked from under us . our people do not worship long . they have too much to think of . they will put up some arches , and a few statues and build tribute houses in a lot of towns , and then they will go on about their business , and we who have fought will feel a bit blank " .
0	that 's impolite , dobbie . it is not proper to try to give your host an injection when he does not want it . but anson drake was ready for him . dobigel 's hand was a full three inches from drake 's thigh when a set of fingers grasped his wrist in a viselike hold . steely fingers bit in , pressing nerves against bone . with a gasp , dobigel opened his hand . a small , metallic cylinder dropped out .
0	same old story , do not rub it in too hard , fellows . breakdown right when we were doing the best stunt of the trip . only for that it would have been a record breaker of a run between second and third stations for the _wireless_ . gee ! but she can fly when she takes the bit between her teeth .
0	well , popinjay ? what do you want with me ?
0	that scout ship . stop it ! he 's trying to make a break ! below them , the _scavenger_ 's jets were flaring . first the pale starter flame , then a long stream of fire , growing longer as the engines developed thrust .
0	who you firin ' at ? that 's my niece , jinny long , an ' you let that boat alone . this ai not the land o ' lynch law . dingley ai not escaped from gaol . you got no right to fire at him .

0	ha , ha , ha ! it 's scalding hot !
0	shut up and sit down , you old jackass ! " i was against this fool idea from the start " ! he yelled . " we have got to keep the illiterates down ; how are we ever going to do that if we go making literates out of them ? but you two thought you were being smart -- "
0	very much the reverse , i should say , think of the broken basins , the waste of marmalade and pepper , not to say anything of the damage to our clothes , and all the rest of it . there are flukes and flukes , and our kind , unfortunately , was not the sort that pays . but , do you know , i do not believe that it rains as fast as it did , and so i am going to harness rocky , and then we will crawl ahead for a few miles ; for if we stop here we shall starve , and i want some dinner .
0	all right , harry , i will meet anybody or anything from bears to indians .
0	fine evening ? what on earth has that got to do with it ? i want to know why you and mrs . beale were out when we arrived .
0	you should have thought of that , before you brought us here .
0	the terms are better than you deserve , and if i had my way i would hang you to the nearest tree as a beginning ! " hemmed in as my men are by six times their number , i have no alternative but to surrender , unfair and outrageous as the terms are , " replied the marauder , with a despairing look as he glanced again at the loyal troops that surrounded his company .
0	provisions ! provisions for secesh , and my husband a colonel in the union army . you get out of here !
0	i knew it ! you get so you can always spot a salesman right off by his sample case . a salesman always has to carry something to show . what are you in , sir ? erickson glanced at him , then down at the sample case on the floor . he grunted . " well , as you can see , i ' m a salesman " .
0	you tend to your housework , and i will manage my own affairs , i meant to put the thing in the safety deposit box over to the bank , and then that sick cow took my mind completely off it . if betty did not take it , bob did . it 's gone , and they ' re the only two that could have put hands on it .
0	here -- you ! " i reckon that 's a patrol . we ' d better scatter them , " ordered bill , going forward in the most brazen manner to capture about twenty men . according to the rules of war this was impossible . hence the sudden appearance of a " brass hat " with a white band on his arm .
0	you ' d better be careful , sir , " a cow , you say " ? karmazinov caught it up at once , his voice grew shriller and shriller . " as for crows and cows , gentlemen , i will refrain . i have too much respect for any audience to permit myself comparisons , however harmless ; but i did think " .

0	but it 's a _ghost_ , i tell you , are ghosts afraid of firearms ?
0	so much for having authority , as well as the will to act ! lambert followed him to the door and called after him , in a clear tone : " you tell him to come down or i will go up . now mind you say just those words " .
0	edith ! dulcie ! phillida ! -- oh ! i can not guess ! there 's not the least clue ! go on , gowan ! i will plump for phillida .
0	why , mrs . landa , lo ' d lioncou ' t never thought of me in the wo ' ld !

0	we will not despair of her , she 's creeping up , poor lady , as whistler said of her . we have passed the phase when everything she did was right in our childish eyes . now we dare to criticize her . that shows we are growing up . she will learn from us , later on . she 's a dear old thing , at heart .
0	so you are real , after all , with a short exclamation of pleasure she crossed the intervening space and knelt at his side . the two regarded each other in silence . at length bill 's lips moved and he started slightly at the weak , toneless sound of his own voice .
0	gone ! within one hour he must be brought back to the kiobeh . if not you must answer with your head ; and now bring the lad to the iron chamber , and see that he does not escape !

" no , " said nimmie amee ; " i think i will keep the husband i now have . he is now trained to draw the water and carry in the wood and hoe the cabbages and weed the flower-beds and dust the furniture and perform many tasks of a like character . a new husband would have to be scolded -- and gently chided -- until he learns my ways . so i think it will be better to keep my chopfyt , and i see no reason why you should object to him . you two gentlemen threw him away when you became tin , because you had no further use for him , so you cannot justly claim him now . i advise you to go back to your own homes and forget me , as i have forgotten you " .

0	no , not wonderful , tom , -- only very ordinary . i have had a chance to learn some things abroad , fortunately . i have taken the time to show you all this because i want you to appreciate what it is we are up against in this case of violet winslow . you can understand now why i was so particular about instructing warrington not to let her go anywhere unattended by friends . there 's nothing inherently impossible in these poisoned needle stories -- given the right conjunction of circumstances . what we have to guard against principally is letting her get into any situation where the circumstances make such a thing possible . i have almost a notion to let the new york end of this case go altogether for a while and take a run up to tuxedo to warn her and mrs . de lancey personally . still , i think i put it strongly enough with warrington so that --

" no , " said helen , trying to be calm . " in a way , i do not care for bob ; that is , i ' m glad i did not marry him . but i do not see why i should stop him coming here when sadie wants to bring him . she 's my friend , and she knows it does bob good . i ' m too angry to flatter you , stephen , but you have some influence -- "

0	bart ! he called satan away from his course , and at the change of direction the stallion staggered , but went on , turned at another call , and headed straight for the stream . he was blind with running ; he was numbed by the long horror of that effort , no doubt , but there was enough strength left in him to understand the master 's mind . he tossed his head high , he flaunted out his tail , and sped with a ghost of his old sweeping gallop toward the bank .

0	a bold idea ! singularly blasphemous , arrogant , and -- fortunately for us all -- impracticable ! allow me to remark that you are overexcited , mr . alwyn ; you talk as madmen may , but as reasonable men should not . come , come and sit down -- you are worn out with the force of your own desperate emotions -- rest a few minutes and recover your self .
0	can a photograph show the clean , sanguine temperament of a man , his impulsive generosity , and cheerful optimism ? " i have not , " said winifred sourly ; " i have , however , seen his picture , and one must admit that he 's reasonably good-looking . in fact , i have seen quite an assortment of them , but it 's , perhaps , significant that the last was taken some years ago " .

" i tried to find the owner of the place , mr . stoner , and paint the picture for him . but he was in europe . so was his wife . and then i found out who his agent was , and i went to him and asked him why he did not fix the place up . he was as coolly polite as an iceberg , but he told me in so many words that it was none of my business . that it was his business to look after the interests of his employer and collect the rents , and not to humor the whims of a few fussy women who had more sentiment than sense " .

0	well ? what 's this ?

0	very well , oh ianito . i shall wait , dantor gripped them tightly to enjoin silence . ianito had located the scientist with the searching ray and was still watching and listening at his crystal . he seemed not to know that blaine and ulana were there .

0	it is really your responsibility , o dalis ! why do you not go out and lead your gens ? if you know , why remain here and watch the destruction of all the people of your gens ?
0	oh -- no and yes . one can never do quite as he pleases while a family and its wishes , aims , and loves are concerned . they always hold him down to some extent . he is an equal hindrance to them . they love each other , and as a result they have to sacrifice their individual wishes . but the family keeps man more social , more gregarious , and less selfish . if we were as free from family love as is the wolf i mentioned , we would be able to live our lives more completely , and , on the other hand , we would die in greater numbers . the love of man and woman for each other and their children lifts humanity out of its serfdom , but it also places limitations . you ought to know more about that than i , however , i merely theorize .

0	oh ! for goodness ' sake , stop ! stop ! let us get out , all had now become conscious of the change . a stagnant heat brooded over everything ; not a breath of wind ; huge banks of magnificent storm- cloud came marching up majestically from the horizon , throwing out little jets of lightning , with solemn murmurs of thunder . drop , drop , drop , tinkled on the gathered leaves , now quicker , now quicker , and thicker . under a huge roof of overhanging rock the party cowered together . at last , down came the storm with a blast like a hurricane , and deluges of rain . on , on it poured relentlessly , with blinding lightning and deafening peals of thunder . hour after hour ! would it never cease ? at last a lull between four and five o ' clock , and , as the tempest rolled murmuring away , the dispirited friends began their preparations for returning . six o ' clock before all had reached the inn . where were the driver and mark ? another tedious hour before they appeared , and each manifestly the worse for liquor . past seven by the time they had fairly started . and now the clouds began to gather again . on they went , furiously at first , and then in unsteady jerks , the omnibus swaying strangely . it was getting dark , and the lowering clouds made it darker still . not a word was spoken by the passengers , but each was secretly dreading the crossing of the stream . at last the bank was gained -- but what a change ! the little brook had become a torrent deep and strong .
0	that is the only true statement in this list of lies . you did not see me all week because i have been constantly at _your_ back . david of trebizond has spent his days riding about orvieto , meeting with the fattori of various trading houses that deal in silks and spices . your servant adds a list below . the cardinal sleeps most of the day and works through the night behind the locked door of his cabinet on the top floor of the palazzo . sometimes he mounts to the roof and studies the stars with the aid of magical instruments . of the servant giancarlo i am unable to make report , having not seen him all this week .

0	that 's just what i feel . it 's alarming to find yourself quite a different human being in less than an hour , to have suddenly developed unsuspected elements in your nature . i never thought i could be such a complete fool , dearest .
0	smell it again ? it could not have been done possibly in less than a minute . what had happened ? where had that minute or so gone ? i felt a sickening sensation .
0	that 's the same thing , " maybe they can win , " suggested sam , " if we go slower than they do " .
0	he asked me what i was trying to do ? so i repeated my question , ' who 's there , ' then he answered , ' the commanding officer end_sentence_quote i replied : ' advance , commanding officer , to be recognized end_sentence_quote he seemed uncertain about it , but i made him step right up to me . when i saw who it was i told him to proceed .
0	do ? why , you will be out scouring the neighborhood for new adventures , i fancy . and as for betty , if i ' m any mind reader , she has something up her sleeve sure enough !
0	why , of course , -- you great big boy ! but you do not have to stop the horse over it . we are on the public highway , too .
0	in that case , i will have to acquit you on that count . there was not , however , anything to prevent you warming up socially . no student has to be asked to do that . you and elice , for instance , took your courses at the same time . normally you would have met at social doings on a hundred occasions ; and still you have never really done so until to-night , several years after you were graduated . you can not square yourself on that score .
0	now you ' re drunk ! douglas pushed back his hat and the noon sun glimmered through the pines on his yellow hair . his clear blue eyes studied scott appraisingly . finally , he said , " i guess , on third thoughts , i will take you back to charleton " .
0	we will soon have you back , soon he had said his say at the club where his supporters , discomfited , awaited him . to demands for a speech , he said he owed to his workers what he could never repay , and that the long years they had kept him in parliament would be the happiest memory of his life .
0	so i do ! he would be really handsome if he did not wear those ugly spectacles . and his jewels are lovely . i wish he would give me some more ! " you are very cruel , nina ! you actually made me think you admired that rich old conte " .
0	well , i ' m not likely to meet the grand duke or the grand duchess . i understand the royal family of russia is a little exclusive .
0	miss carrington ! think she will retail it to the dear public ?
0	i think it was a mutual picking up , and we picked each other up , we knew that sanford and his crew were extremely anxious to find the ship 's company , and if we joined them we should be sure to come out right .
0	' no , no , no ! you shall not go . i will throw myself at the feet of the empress , and never rise until she has released you , dear sister .
0	do not be such a dear old stick , i want you to like him because i find him so interesting . you see , as he gets to know one a little better he does not seem to mind talking about the war . you others will scarcely say a word of what you have seen or of what is being done out there . i like to be told things by people who have actually seen them . he happened to be ten minutes early this evening and he gave me a most fascinating description of some skirmishing near la bassee .
0	we must not let them get away to try some new scheme ! martin , take fifty men and beat them back to the break in the wall . go around a side street . they move so slowly that you can easily cut off their retreat .
0	i really have been thinking about it . do you suppose it could be bought reasonably ? it 's really a pretty place . and there 's a hundred acres -- or there was . i would like to have a modest house somewhere in the country . " very well . buy me the old hotel greensleeve " .
0	i ' m sure i do not know what you mean , young man , " well , well , " gasped the unknown , " a moll , swelp me ! welcome to our roost , ' bo ! you hit it right . this is hoboes ' home . there 's nine ' boes of us got a shack up ahead . welcome , ma ' am . what 's your line ? con game or just busted " ?
0	is not fanny here ? " what am i to do with miss wilton ? i ' m going for a long walk with the slater girls . she can not possibly go so far , and besides , we do not want children " .
0	what , sir ? " as to insulting language , my lord , i think you need not complain , when you remember that you have just called me a swindler , because i have been unable to accomplish your wish and my own , by marrying my cousin . however , i will let that pass . i have done the best i could to gain that object . i did more than either of us thought it possible that i should do , when i consented to attempt it . i offered her my hand , and assured her of my affection , without falsehood or hypocrisy . my bargain was that i should offer to her . i have done more than that , for i have loved her . i have , however , been refused , and in such a manner as to convince me that it would be useless for me to renew my suit . if your lordship will allow me to advise you on such a subject , i would suggest that you make no further objection to fanny 's union with lord ballindine . for marry him she certainly will " .
0	ha ! saint james ! " men of wanmeeting and brothers , " he said , " to-day you shall prove yourselves worthy of your lady paramount , of your late master , and of me . galors de born , the arch-enemy , is skulking in his strong tower , not daring to attack us . men of wanmeeting , we will go and bait him . hauterive is ours . follow me , crying , ha ! saint james " !
0	gentlemen , three cheers for the resumption of the land of england by the people of england ! hip , hip , hurrah !
0	ho there , you villain ! stay your steps ! i am desperately in need of you this day !
0	get off my head ! " i will be careful " ! he called , and the next instant hit my shoulders and i shook him off on top of lord ivy .
0	good-bye ! remember that in six months we start on another cruise .
0	very well , keep it then , " no sell grub , " she answered sullenly . " give all you want if you come with me " .
0	you do not worry me ! you do not worry me ! and the other gently continued , " ai not them gloves the same yu ' wore to your last weddin ' " ?
0	i have yet to see that trader in thirty years ' experience . admit that his goods did measure up to our standard . what would he have to charge for them ? we buy in vast quantities -- in some cases we take the entire output of factories , and we have an established system of transportation to get it into the wilds . no free trader can compete with us -- cost plus freight would ruin him , especially as he must allow the indians a debt . " but , " objected connie , " suppose a free trader dealt in goods as good as yours -- "
0	all right -- er -- gridley , in the ratio of your repentance i feel proportionately happy . you have relieved my mind of a cloud that has shut out a lot of sunshine these past months , which otherwise would have been entirely bright . so i absolve you , sir ! now let the talk die .
0	why should not it ? " if it would only go on for ever " ! she continued . " i ' m so hungry for happiness " .
0	as riches go , in the town of mercer , as for my laurels , they have not yet begun to chafe .
0	and here , too , " it 's getting light here , hal , " called chester .
0	but that 's different ! " about the same pleasure that you find in batting a foolish little tennis ball about , " she said , and nan caught her up indignantly .
0	er -- quite true ; but possibly the daughter may be a compensation . " that 's square ! just like you , jimmy . course i knew you ' d play fair -- it 's only my grouch . i remember now . madam g . gave you a bid to dine with her " .
0	do you remember him , allan ? but no , i fancy you were too little . he used to visit at our house when i was a child , and i was never so afraid of any one . i suppose you have heard the story of his wedding ? " i did not really think it ; i only wondered , " said rosalind .
0	oh , laddy , what a gallant speech ! i ' m sorry , but i have dad 's orders .
0	since that fellow is above taking a message , go you , and deliver it , her ladyship knows enough of your language to understand . say to her , if she is not at my tent door in ten minutes i will fetch her . she will not like that .
0	i guess if anyone saw me wo ' king in the fields they would think i was a disgrace to the neighbahood . " then labor in the fields with them " .
0	it is always the best way , cary , when you see him put his head down ! " o annas ! why did you take the bull by the horns " ? i cried .
0	so it was vera , was it ? i heard what she said -- i mean , it was repeated to me . you were one of that party ?
0	not wolves -- it will be a she-wolf ! " hush now listen ; from the sheep he will go on to the wolves " .
0	are we winning ? tell me , that we are winning ! around the church itself were the texans under hood , stalwart , sunburned men who could ride like comanches , some of whom when lads had been present at san jacinto , when the texans struck with such terrible might and success for liberty .
0	ah , that comes a little later . " to learn to live -- and then , to live , " replied he .
0	yes ! i am hereward , the berserker , the brain-hewer , the land-thief , the sea-thief , the feeder of wolf and raven , -- aoi ! ere my beard was grown , i was a match for giants . how much more now , that i am a man whom ladies love ? many a champion has quailed before my very glance . how much more , now that i wear torfrida 's gift ? aoi !
0	unmask ! the knight of the cumberland , after a moment 's hesitation , threw his leg over the saddle and came to the steps with a slouching gait and looking about him right and left . the blight , blushing prettily , took the chaplet and went down the steps to meet him .
0	long live our comrades , the workingmen of italy ! " capital fellows , our comrades the french " ! cried some one , as if intoxicated with his own mirth .
0	stuff his lying mouth with his orders ! " i think one does not expec ' monsieur to fight anybody . would i fight you , you think ? that was why i had my servants , that evening we play . i would gladly fight almos ' any one in the won ' ; but i did not wish to soil my hand with a -- "
0	how absurd and childish he is ! but he is true and able . and how glad you should be that you are able to make true friends , without an effort . yesterday i met neighbour fairley , and another little old elder who keeps his chin in his collar and his eyes on the sky . they did little else but sing your praises . one might have thought that you had invented the world-or hamley . " he is no respecter of persons . his humour cuts deep . he has a wide heart for your sex . when leaving the court of the king of abyssinia he said to his majesty : ' well , good-bye , king . give my love to the girls end_sentence_quote "
0	that puts it on myself -- or the big boss ! " the one on the second floor of the office building " .
0	ha ! ha ! ha ! look who wants to see the general .
0	do not wonder you ' re willing to give it up , uncle sim . " i do not know about the pound of tea -- but it 's given away . giving it away because i can not deal with it myself . calls for some one with more ingenuity -- so i have told ' em about you " .
0	hurrah ! i have done such a deed !
0	and what did uncle westonley say ? " oh , yes , beautifully , and jim had his forehead cut , and a lot of blood came " .
0	what , put myself in the hands of a young fool so that he may fill his empty pockets with your money ! where do i come in ? good heavens , westoby , you ' re crazy ! think what would happen to me if it came to doctor saltworthy 's ears ? he ' d never have anything more to do with me !
0	what ? a what how much which ?
0	well , mr . bones , what _is_ the answer ? " absolutely -- provided you were in mine " .
0	go below , mr . mcgaw , and take it easy . you can make it up to me some time when there is no moon ! mate mcgaw fiddled a gnarled finger under his nose and tried to find some words of protest . but captain mayo added a crisp command .
0	too bad ! you promised me a minute , felix !
0	why , then , god keep us from your worst , open me this door .
0	then , what makes you rate their intelligence above the human ? we have finally cracked open the atom !
0	he cannot be so very far away . gondrin ! where are you ? the doctor and the commandant looked everywhere about them ; gondrin 's soldier 's coat lay there beside a heap of black mud , and his wheelbarrow , spade , and pickaxe were visible , but there was no sign of the man himself along the various pebbly watercourses , for the wayward mountain streams had hollowed out channels that were almost overgrown with low bushes .
0	name it ! name it ! i will do anything !
0	back nearly three hours ago , sergeant , it 's half-past eight . i have been occupied , and have missed my breakfast . come into the house and breakfast with me , sergeant overton . sergeant dinsmore will look after things outdoors .
0	who 's there ? you can not come in ! thurston was evidently at home , for a prolonged shout of laughter and the clamour of several voices reached diggory 's ears as he approached the study . as he knocked at the door the noise suddenly ceased , there was a moment 's silence , and then a murmur in a low tone , followed by a scuffling of feet and the overturning of a chair .
0	i got a check , " tell us , then " ! ordered hazelton gruffly .
0	oh , i have heard of good cousin peter since i was an imp of a boy ! cousin peter was my chart whereby to steer through the shoals of boyish mischief into the haven of our uncle george 's good graces . oh , i have heard over much of you , cousin , from dear , kind , well-meaning relatives and friends -- damn ' em ! they rang your praises in my ears , morning , noon , and night . and why ? -- simply that i might come to surpass you in virtue , learning , wit , and appearance , and so win our uncle george 's regard , and , incidentally , his legacy . but i was a young demon , romping with the grooms in the stable , while you were a young angel in nankeens , passing studious hours with your books . when i was a scapegrace at harrow , you were winning golden opinions at eton ; when you were an ' honors ' man at oxford , i was ' rusticated ' at cambridge . naturally enough , perhaps , i grew sick of the name of peter ( and , indeed , it smacks damnably of fish , do not you think ) ? -- you , or your name , crossed me at every turn . if it was not for cousin peter , i was heir to ten thousand a year ; but good cousin peter was so fond of uncle george , and uncle george was so fond of good cousin peter , that maurice might go hang for a graceless dog and be damned to him !
0	not since you came back , " have you seen him recently " ?
0	a heap sight you know about _hist ' ry_ ! " bosh nothin ' " ! declared another . " you read history an ' you will get lots of cases where streams showed up , and then vanished under mountains , more than once " .
0	only for dinner , where do we get dinner , sir ?
0	show low . he 's a regular brass band when he gets started -- from the big trombone down to the tin whistle , " what 's that " ? asked sage-brush , grabbing his revolver .
0	let go , mag , do not throttle me ! about a quarter of an hour later , a sort of bundle rolled rather than walked into the collinses ' neat little cottage . mrs . collins uttered an exclamation and darted forward . she did not at once recognize that the bundle consisted of marjorie and eric , who , with peals and bursts of laughter , had in this style intruded themselves into her modest dwelling .
0	ridiculous ! you talk like an old woman . and i never think of you as older than myself .
0	we did not find francis edward david till the middle of december , and it 's now the third week in january . i do not think we have let much grass grow under our feet . " it 's simply heavenly , and i do not know how we got along without it " ! she cried , rapturously . " it makes me wild to think of the _months_ we have wasted this fall " .
0	very well , i will take it out if you will stay quiet here and not get into mischief before they come . " no , they would , to please me " .
0	now thet 's so , too , ye ' re cute , yer air .
0	if it ran across my pillow i should die of fright , i know i should ! i wish mrs . wilson would let us have the cat to sleep with us . i should feel far safer .
0	it does not , either , and we are not afraid of you ; not a bit . go on out to california , if you want to , but do not you bother us . and do not you bother my mother , or you will get in trouble .
0	you must not do that , sir . it is against the regulations to approach the gang , nekhludoff got down and approached the women , meaning to ask maslova if she had got the things he had sent her , and how she was feeling , but the convoy sergeant , who was walking on that side , noticed him at once , and ran towards him .
0	' jude ! you ' re the cow ropingest girl in the rockies ! say , jude , ai not you afraid that baa-baa you ' re riding will buck with you ? swift ! what a hell of a name for that thing !
0	it seems to me , that so much education is thrown away on the stock market .
0	it 's a lie ! i ' m able to lick e ' er a keenan that ever went on nate 's leather -- an ' that 's my chat .
0	i see it ! " hi , stanley " ! he called out , as the others came from the mill . " get my cap , will you ? the wind blew it off . it 's back there somewhere " .
0	haul down the foresail , cyd ! be quick , but be careful of yourself .
0	money , yes -- there is money for all concerned , and to spare .
0	and how about your hand ? " he is the best dog in the world , miss brock . mr . bucks gave him to me when i first came to the mountains -- we were puppies together -- "
0	he 's passing it off as a joke , casey . but as suddenly as he had begun the buckskin desisted . he heaved a sigh , stood still , and turned a mildly inquiring , backward eye on his rider . it was as if he had said : " what ! still there ? you surprise me " !
0	go to the devil ! i have told you already ! " i should like very much to know what fault you have to find with my work , " said pelle obstinately .
0	well , well ! so little mama 's boy is tired , eh ? poor little fellow . i will buy a glass case and keep you in a corner of my house just as if you were the virgin mary 's own little son . you have got to reach home first , see ? so i will help you a little , sonny !
0	only six months . yes . but what months ! he went on as if he had not heard her . " it would not have mattered if it had been bad all through . but neither you nor i , jinny , have ever written , probably we never shall write , anything to compare with the beginning of that book . my god ! to think that there were only six months -- six months -- between that beginning and that end " .
0	oh -- i beg your pardon ! i did not know i was yellin ' . i thought you was the deaf feller .
0	yes , and swift-pacer , " made a lot of money in his time , though , has not he " ?
0	neither , when it comes to that -- ! waymarsh at last turned over with a groan . " well , i will not marry you " !
0	halloa , jack , " so it is , " said master nugent , but without any display of enthusiasm .
0	oh , i do not know about that , but this paper has strengthened a suspicion that i have had for a little time -- strengthened it so much that i feel almost convinced i am right since hearing what the doctor says about this matter .
0	go ahead -- you can do it , you can do anybody .
0	never ! " what miserable swine you are " ! cried lupin scornfully . he sprang forward , caught up the kit-bag in his left hand , and tossed it behind him into the lift . " you dirty crew " ! he cried again . " oh , why is not there a photographer here ? and now , guerchard , you thief , give me back my pocket-book " .
0	la , yes , they finished up the babtizin ' two weeks after that . it was a nice , pleasant day , and young amos went under the water all right ; but mighty little good it did him after all . for as soon as he come of age , he married matildy harris ( matildy was a methodist ) , and he got to goin ' to church with his wife , and that was the last of his babtist raisin ' .

0	no , i am not afraid of him , but i do not underrate him . the men look up to torrini as a sort of leader ; he 's an effective speaker , and knows very well how to fan a dissatisfaction . either he or some other disturbing element has recently been at work among the men . there 's considerable grumbling in the yard . " i believe you are actually afraid of the fellow " .

0	oh , all right ! have your own way about it ! let us suppose , solely for the sake of argument , that the lieutenant was taken prisoner and went away against his will . does that prove that he was taken from the island ?

0	indeed we do , just as we do out of our men . yet the women of this age are very happy , and those of the nineteenth century , unless contemporary references greatly mislead us , were very miserable . the reason that women nowadays are so much more efficient co-laborers with the men , and at the same time are so happy , is that , in regard to their work as well as men 's , we follow the principle of providing every one the kind of occupation he or she is best adapted to . women being inferior in strength to men , and further disqualified industrially in special ways , the kinds of occupation reserved for them , and the conditions under which they pursue them , have reference to these facts . the heavier sorts of work are everywhere reserved for men , the lighter occupations for women . under no circumstances is a woman permitted to follow any employment not perfectly adapted , both as to kind and degree of labor , to her sex . moreover , the hours of women 's work are considerably shorter than those of men 's , more frequent vacations are granted , and the most careful provision is made for rest when needed . the men of this day so well appreciate that they owe to the beauty and grace of women the chief zest of their lives and their main incentive to effort , that they permit them to work at all only because it is fully understood that a certain regular requirement of labor , of a sort adapted to their powers , is well for body and mind , during the period of maximum physical vigor . we believe that the magnificent health which distinguishes our women from those of your day , who seem to have been so generally sickly , is owing largely to the fact that all alike are furnished with healthful and inspiriting occupation . " it was thought one of the most grievous features of our civilization that we required so much toil from women , " i said ; " but it seems to me you get more out of them than we did " .

0	good ! you have been smoking a good many of them lately , and i have noticed that you complained of your lungs . how can your lungs be in any condition when you are constantly inhaling so much of that smoke ! i know of a young fellow with weak lungs who went into quick consumption , and the doctors said cigarettes were entirely responsible . he smoked a number of packages a day . when he started he simply smoked now and then , but the habit grew on him , and at last he was unable to break it .
0	richard ! do not be silly . i suppose i shall always be jealous of you when a girl , as beautiful as ruth morton , is concerned . after all , to be jealous is only a woman 's way of paying tribute to another woman 's charms .

0	don ippolito , you are another da vinci , a universal genius . the whole place was an outgrowth of himself ; it was his history as well as his character . it recorded his quaint and childish tastes , his restless endeavors , his partial and halting successes . the ante-room in which he had paused with ferris was painted to look like a grape-arbor , where the vines sprang from the floor , and flourishing up the trellised walls , with many a wanton tendril and flaunting leaf , displayed their lavish clusters of white and purple all over the ceiling . it touched ferris , when don ippolito confessed that this decoration had been the distraction of his own vacant moments , to find that it was like certain grape-arbors he had seen in remote corners of venice before the doors of degenerate palaces , or forming the entrances of open-air restaurants , and did not seem at all to have been studied from grape- arbors in the country . he perceived the archaic striving for exact truth , and he successfully praised the mechanical skill and love of reality with which it was done ; but he was silenced by a collection of paintings in don ippolito 's parlor , where he had been made to sit down a moment . hard they were in line , fixed in expression , and opaque in color , these copies of famous masterpieces , -- saints of either sex , ascensions , assumptions , martyrdoms , and what not , -- and they were not quite comprehensible till don ippolito explained that he had made them from such prints of the subjects as he could get , and had colored them after his own fancy . all this , in a city whose art had been the glory of the world for nigh half a thousand years , struck ferris as yet more comically pathetic than the frescoed grape-arbor ; he stared about him for some sort of escape from the pictures , and his eye fell upon a piano and a melodeon placed end to end in a right angle . don ippolito , seeing his look of inquiry , sat down and briefly played the same air with a hand upon each instrument .
0	but you thought i was capable of underhanded tactics ? that 's not very flattering , young man . " i did not think you ' d be in on anything as underhanded as this looked , so i assumed that you were acting against your will " .

0	you would in the first place have to shave off your moustachios , gerald , and i fear that even after you had done so there would be nothing venerable in your appearance ; and whatever the mission with which you might pretend to charge yourself , your chances of obtaining a private interview with the lady would be slight . " very well ; so be it , geoffrey , " gerald burke said , holding out his hand to him . " if your mind is made up i will not argue the question with you , and indeed i value your companionship and aid too highly to try to shake your determination . let us then at once talk over what is now our joint enterprise . ribaldo estate lies about halfway between this and seville , and we passed within a few miles of it as we came hither . the first thing , of course , will be to procure some sort of disguise in which i can see inez and have a talk with her . now , it seems to me , for i have been thinking the matter over in every way as we rode , that the only disguise in which this would be possible would be that of a priest or monk " .

0	jour -- our -- nal ! fi-i-i-ve cents ! meanwhile , down in the main street of the city it was a confusing scene . it was darker there than where the streets were more open ; and although there were several daring spirits of that adventurous turn of mind which leads people into byways of discovery , who asserted that the street lamps were lighted , it was not generally believed . the snow was blowing down and up and across , and getting more and more unmanageable under the feet of foot passengers every moment . it was cold and windy and blinding and crowded , and a good many other disconcerting things , all of which mr . gilton felt the full force of as he stood on the corner where he had just bought his turkey . it was a fine turkey , and had been a good bargain , and though he had to carry it home himself , there was nothing derogatory in that . if it had been anybody else he would have been thrilled with a glow of satisfaction , but mr . gilton was long past glows of satisfaction -- it was years since he had permitted himself to have such things .

0	oh , i am not vexed ! indeed , i am rather glad he spoke out -- at my age one does not often get the chance of being sincerely scolded by a perfectly frank young man . one does get donnish and superior , no doubt , and it is useful to find it out , though it is not pleasant at the time . we have made it up , and he was quite repentant ; i think it is altogether natural . it often happens with young men to get irritated with one , no doubt , but as a rule they do not speak out ; and this time he has got me between the joints of my armour . maud looked up at him with a troubled and rather indignant air . " jack is perfectly horrid just now , " she said ; " i can not think what has come over him ; and considering that you have been coaching him every day , and getting him shooting and fishing , it seems to me quite detestable ! i ought not to say that ; but you must not be angry with him , mr . kennedy . i think he is feeling very independent just now , and he said to me that it made him feel that he was back at school to have to go up with his books to the manor every morning . but he is all right really . i am sure he is grateful ; it would be too shameful if he were not . please do not be vexed with him " .

0	call for me in time to catch the 6.30 express , they were hardly out of sight of the post office when a hansom-cab drew up at the door , and a young man , looking furtively round , hastily alit and hurried into the office to enquire for letters . one was handed to him with the letters o.h.m.s. upon it , which he opened , signed the certificate enclosed and received from the savings-bank clerk a sum of money in gold . pocketing the money , he hurried into his cab and drove away . the man was villiers wyckliffe , and there was anything but a pleasant look on his face , for at heart he was an arrant coward . " confound those fellows , " he muttered to himself , " they may get here at any time . i had to come back here for money , but i will go back to toowoomba again , as it is a handy place to make for the open country at a moment 's notice . who in the deuce would have thought that a fellow would make so much fuss over a girl as that fellow morris is doing . he and his friend mean mischief , for dick told me of their carryings-on at melbourne . if they track me i will shoot them down like the dogs they are . if i could only get away i ' d go back to england , for people are not so particular there . damn australia , i say ! i wish i had never seen it " . his face had grown black with anger , and falling back , he fell to commiserating his lot .

0	they do not want to make a profit . seems to me it 's their programme to get hold of the rights cheap , and then worry you because they can not run the logs through this ca on . the legislature will not give you land or rights to do nothing with , and it 's quite likely the charters people will file a notification that your workings are the obstacle . still , they ' d probably make you an offer first . if you let them in on the ground-floor -- handed them a big slice of the valley or something of the kind -- they ' d let up on their timber rights . i ' m not sure they could run good milling fir to that mill at a profit .
0	what 's the difference ? some of us are not any better than monkeys , anyway . " i will never believe i came from them , " cried eda , vehement in her disgust .

0	to be a doctor ? i saved up once -- got most five hundred dollars and a feller came along and persuaded me to put it into some land . well , i got the land still . no , ma ' am , there ai not much chance to change for the workingman when he 's once fixed in his creek bed . he must just roll along with the rest the best he can . and i ' m better off than most because i have got a paying trade . lots of boys like me and my brothers do not learn ever to do anything , and just slave on all their lives at any job comes handy until they are all wore out . lots and lots . their folks can not keep ' em in school and they never know enough to more ' n sign their names . all they are good for is rough work , same as the dago helper here . he thinks two dollars a day big money . i guess it is to him .
0	well , you _are_ bored . pshaw , my dear ! lie down and get a little beauty sleep . then we will go driving and see that charming spot dr . ballard told us about . i ' m sure he will call to-night .

0	very good , my straightforward child , but look , there is the man ! here , good gibbus -- come here ! -- now , just consider : supposing you had flattered some one so grossly that you had offended him instead of pleasing him : how would you explain the state of affairs in telling me of it ?
0	for once , you have failed to read accurately the statutes of the order . it is positively refreshing . i was beginning to feel that you were altogether too accurate . in fact the scourging of a delinquent vestal is a mere disciplinary regulation , designed to assure the maintenance of the fire . it is not in the nature of a mandatory atonement . it has nothing in common with an act of expiation . it has nothing to do with placating or propitiating the goddess . it has no likeness whatever to the punishment of a guilty vestal .

0	ay , ay , the committee ! mr . carvel is right . take him to the committee !

0	fetch up that frenchman , they locked the door on the inside , clambered through the window and scaled the wall . they sped through the deserted streets with all haste . they came to the landing-place and found the skiff tugging at her painter with her sails all unfurled . presently they were under way for the _heavenly home_ , and , having come safely aboard , hauled up the mainsail , set the jib and were about to slip the anchor . then they heard the clang , clang , clang of a bell -- a warning clang , clang , clang , which could mean but one thing : discovery .
0	i would not dare do that with such a tyrant as you , dear master . his voice grew gentle and he laid his hand on her shoulder . " you have the secret , my child -- to know the meaning of happiness , and not to be afraid of sadness , but to pour it all into the music . that is the secret , and it will make you a musician , -- it will carry you far , i think , -- provided you do not neglect your practising , " he added brusquely .

0	man up the tree ! one day , in the following spring , i was riding home from the station with euphemia , -- we seldom took pleasure-drives now , we were so busy on the place , -- and as we reached the house i heard the dog barking savagely . he was loose in the little orchard by the side of the house . as i drove in , pomona came running to the carriage .

0	quartermaster ! maclean smiled at the caution ; but next instant a bright flash quivered from the other vessel 's side , and involuntarily he ducked his head , for something flew dipping and shrieking over the _saigon_ . in the following second there was heard the clap of the distant cannon and the splash of a shell striking the sea close at hand . invisible hands unfolded and shook out three balls of bunting at the truck of the war-ship 's signal boom . they fluttered for awhile , and then spread out to the breeze . the arms of russia surmounted two lines of symbolic letters .

0	good-bye , having got the child on his back , the animal gave a leap into the air , and came down so like a feather that europa did not know when his hoofs touched the ground . he then began a race to that part of the flowery plain where her three brothers were , and where they had just caught their splendid butterfly . europa screamed with delight ; and phoenix , cilix , and cadmus stood gaping at the spectacle of their sister mounted on a white bull , not knowing whether to be frightened or to wish the same good luck for themselves . the gentle and innocent creature ( for who could possibly doubt that he was so ) ? pranced round among the children as sportively as a kitten . europa all the while looked down upon her brothers , nodding and laughing , but yet with a sort of stateliness in her rosy little face . as the bull wheeled about to take another gallop across the meadow , the child waved her hand , and said , " good-bye , " playfully pretending that she was now bound on a distant journey , and might not see her brothers again for nobody could tell how long .

0	will you ? i rather wonder at it .
0	main force ! why did not they shoot , or yell , or make some sort of a row that would have brought help ? i have got a lot of old women here who could have stood off an attacking party ! force -- nothing ! lieutenant rowe was in the deal . he wanted to disappear with something he had in his possession , and he worked the abduction dodge .

0	the gods would indeed be careless to leave any good things within your reach , unless they were meant for you , " i agree with you in the abstract most heartily ; but the only bold thing that i have seen miss burton do was to run under the feet of my horses . you might as well call a ray of sunshine bold and forward ; and people like sunshine when it is as nicely tempered as her manner is . i confess that when i first learned who she was , and before i had met her personally , i was greatly prejudiced against her , but one would have to be a churl indeed to remain proof against her genial good-nature . for my part i intend to enjoy it , as i do all the other good things the gods throw in my way " .

0	keep the line , huni ! this one had broader shoulders than his companions , and his burden weighed on him comparatively lightly . " in this solitude , " thought he , " which repels man , and forbids his passing his life here , the chnemu , the laborers who form the world , have spared themselves the trouble of filling up the seams , and rounding off the corners . how is it that man should have dedicated this hideous land -- in which even the human heart seems to be hardened against all pity -- to the merciful hathor ? perhaps because it so sorely stands in need of the joy and peace which the loving goddess alone can bestow " .

0	that 's out ! most of these people can not read . and even those that do do not trust what they read . a piece of paper , in their eyes , is no return for some goats , or flour , camels , horses , or whatever else it might be we need . no , we ' re going to have to pay our way .

0	well , i ' m not a millionaire , anyway , lindau , and i hope you will not make an example of me by refusing to give toil . i dare say the millionaires deserve it , but i ' d rather they would not suffer in my person . lindau furiously interrupted : " yes , when they have gathered their millions together from the hunger and cold and nakedness and ruin and despair of hundreds of thousands of other men , they ' give work ' to the poor ! they give work ! they allow their helpless brothers to earn enough to keep life in them ! they give work ! who is it gives toil , and where will your rich men be when once the poor shall refuse to give toil ' ? why , you have come to give me work " !

0	hi ! old nebuchadnezzar , where are you ? a thin curl of blue smoke issued from the copper funnel that projected above the mass of snow which had accumulated upon the deck of the _hansa_ . the owner was sparing of his fuel , and it was only the non-conducting layer of ice enveloping the tartan that rendered the internal temperature endurable .

0	ulyulyulyulyu ! " ulyulyu " ! cried nicholas , in a voice not his own , and of its own accord his good horse darted headlong downhill , leaping over gullies to head off the wolf , and the borzois passed it , running faster still . nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping , nor see the borzois , nor the ground over which he went : he saw only the wolf , who , increasing her speed , bounded on in the same direction along the hollow . the first to come into view was milka , with her black markings and powerful quarters , gaining upon the wolf . nearer and nearer . now she was ahead of it ; but the wolf turned its head to face her , and instead of putting on speed as she usually did milka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs .

0	charge ! at one point the crowd was thick about the gate of a walled courtyard , thundering on it with crowbars and axes ; here , again , the prince paused to look sharply among them , lest somewhere there might be a brown head and a pale clear-cut face that he sought . even as he tightened his bridle , the gate gave rendingly ; he turned his head as the mob , roaring , poured in . for the space of perhaps a second he sat motionless and stricken , but it was long enough to see what he never forgot -- a woman , composed , serene , bright against her dark background in the shifting light of the burning house , gay in saffron and white . then the mob surged before her and hid her , and his voice returned to him .
0	i command the peace ! no one paid the least attention .

0	you will have to put up with a good deal of that sort of thing , i fear . even i , myself , have discovered that i unknowingly possessed heaps of friends . when i go into the exchange now , a dozen or more men -- shipowners , brokers , and others -- insist on shaking hands with me and asking me to dinner . when i was in sydney last and was badly in want of a berth no less than three of these very men metaphorically kicked me out of their offices when i applied to them . but now that i am agent and manager to ' the rich mrs . tracey ' they can not find words to express their admiration of my talents and all-round virtues . " friends ! no , not friends -- merely people who want to know me because i am rich . and i do not want to make friends . the other afternoon a mrs . bell-lovatt and her two daughters called to see me , and mrs . bell-lovatt simply gushed over me for half an hour and made me feel quite sick with her odious flattery . i knew the girls when i was at school in melbourne , but i have never seen them since and had no wish to see them again " .

0	you ' d better come ashore , the mate , of course , stepped back , and griffin got into the boat , which was soon on its way to the land . on nearing the shore , it was found that a tremendous surf broke upon the beach -- owing to its exposure to the long rolling swell of the pacific . when the boat , which was a small one , entered this surf , it became apparent that the attempt to land was full of danger . each wave that bore them on its crest for a second , and then left them behind , was so gigantic that nothing but careful steering could save them from turning broadside on , and being rolled over like a cask . griffin was a skilful steersman , but he evidently was not at that time equal to the occasion . he steered wildly . when they were close to the beach the boat upset . every man swam towards a place where a small point of land caused a sort of eddy and checked the force of the undertow . they all reached it in a few minutes , with the exception of griffin , who had found bottom on a sand-bank , and stood , waist deep , laughing , apparently , at the struggles of his comrades .

0	well , you should not complain . you lost your napoleon , but gained experience . you have a new wrinkle . i gained a new wrinkle too when i gave a half-napoleon , by mistake , to a wretched looking beggar , blind of one eye . i intended to give him a centime . " i tried that game , " said mr . figgs , ruefully , " in naples . i went into a broker 's shop to change a napoleon . i thought i ' d like to see their financial system . i saw enough of it ; for the scoundrel gave me a lot of little bits of coin that only passed for a few cents apiece in naples , with difficulty at that , and will not pass here at all " !
0	not in a green and yellow room , i will tell you what i think . if i had a tea table to match the living-room furniture , and it sat beside the hearth , and on it a chafing dish to cook in , and the willow ware to eat from , we could have little tea parties in there , when we are not very hungry or to treat a visitor . it would help make that room ' homey , ' and it 's wonderful how they harmonize with the other things .

0	i suppose it 's in the heart , after all ; but my father is never so happy as when he is in the midst of misery . his pot of gold seems to lie down on willow lane . " i have heard of him , " she said , smiling at the glow of pride in the son 's eyes . " and where did he discover it " ?
0	excuse me , prince , excuse me , but now that will not do , the matter must be clearly stated , for it is obviously not properly understood . they are calling in some legal chicanery , and upon that ground they are threatening to turn us out of the house ! really , prince , do you think we are such fools as not to be aware that this matter does not come within the law , and that legally we cannot claim a rouble from you ? but we are also aware that if actual law is not on our side , human law is for us , natural law , the law of common-sense and conscience , which is no less binding upon every noble and honest man -- that is , every man of sane judgment -- because it is not to be found in miserable legal codes . if we come here without fear of being turned out ( as was threatened just now ) because of the imperative tone of our demand , and the unseemliness of such a visit at this late hour ( though it was not late when we arrived , we were kept waiting in your anteroom ) , if , i say , we came in without fear , it is just because we expected to find you a man of sense ; i mean , a man of honour and conscience . it is quite true that we did not present ourselves humbly , like your flatterers and parasites , but holding up our heads as befits independent men . we present no petition , but a proud and free demand ( note it well , we do not beseech , we demand ) ! . we ask you fairly and squarely in a dignified manner . do you believe that in this affair of burdovsky you have right on your side ? do you admit that pavlicheff overwhelmed you with benefits , and perhaps saved your life ? if you admit it ( which we take for granted ) , do you intend , now that you are a millionaire , and do you not think it in conformity with justice , to indemnify burdovsky ? yes or no ? if it is yes , or , in other words , if you possess what you call honour and conscience , and we more justly call common-sense , then accede to our demand , and the matter is at an end . give us satisfaction , without entreaties or thanks from us ; do not expect thanks from us , for what you do will be done not for our sake , but for the sake of justice . if you refuse to satisfy us , that is , if your answer is no , we will go away at once , and there will be an end of the matter . but we will tell you to your face before the present company that you are a man of vulgar and undeveloped mind ; we will openly deny you the right to speak in future of your honour and conscience , for you have not paid the fair price of such a right . i have no more to say -- i have put the question before you . now turn us out if you dare . you can do it ; force is on your side . but remember that we do not beseech , we demand ! we do not beseech , we demand !
0	i will not need it . all i shall ever ask of you is that first $ 39,000 . the water i have bottled up in the sierra will make the land worth three hundred dollars an acre . do not you see where i can afford to pay ten dollars per acre for it ? " mcgraw , " said dunstan rising impatiently , " you ' re a consummate ass ! where the devil do you expect to get $ 320,000 to buy their land from them ? i suppose you think i will help you with that , also . your stupidity annoys me , robert . damme , sir , you ' re light in the upper story " .

0	that 's my end of it , but when i do ask her i wish to say that you desire it , too , for kate might not think it agreeable to you .

0	you ' re away off ! it may have been sheep herders who got dad 's papers , hoping thus to be able to claim a lot of land for their woolly feeders , but professor wright had no hand in it .

0	not on any account . i want to see the whole list of flats that mr . fulkerson thought would be the very thing for us . it was a janitress , large , fat , with her arms wound up in her apron , who received them there . mrs . march gave her a succinct but perfect statement of their needs . she failed to grasp the nature of them , or feigned to do so . she shook her head , and said that her son would show them the flat . there was a radiator visible in the narrow hall , and isabel tacitly compromised on steam heat without an elevator , as the flat was only one flight up . when the son appeared from below with a small kerosene hand-lamp , it appeared that the flat was unfurnished , but there was no stopping him till he had shown it in all its impossibility . when they got safely away from it and into the street march said : " well , have you had enough for to-night , isabel ? shall we go to the theatre now " ?

0	only that sir james thinks he has to-day seen one of the most remarkable men he ever met in his life . the two elder ladies closed on eustace directly to congratulate him on the success of his arrangements , and dermot jumped up from the sofa , while viola caught hold of my hand , and we all made for the window which opened on the terrace . " tell her , " said viola to her brother , as we stood outside .

0	how pretty your mother must have been . " well , if i had a wife , " the captain had said , " i ' d like to have her wear bright things . my mother had dimity dresses -- there was a pink one , like a rose , and a green one that looked like the young grass in the spring , and there was one that made me think of forget-me-nots , or the sky when there is not a cloud in it " .
0	fishing ! trips of a poetaster ! it 's then i write best , and write i will ! there 's a poem , and a damned good one , too , old preacher , in every gill of whiskey , and i ' m the lad that can extract it ! lord ! what 's better than to be out in the open , all by yourself in the woods , or on the river ? think of the long nights alone with the glory of heaven and a good demijohn . why , a man 's thoughts are like actors performing in the air and all the crowding stars for audience ! you know in your soul you ' d rather have me out there , going it all by myself , than raising thunder over town . and you know , too , it does not tell on me ; it does not show ! you could not guess , to save your life , how much i have had to-day , now , could you ?
0	i have a headache , do not think i ' d better play to-night .
0	well done ! , every task completed !
0	do not fly away without us , doctor ! he climbed briskly out of the car and descended . joe had swung himself down from branch to branch , and was waiting for him below , stretching his limbs in the mean time .
0	oh ! this is awful , the water is running down my neck , and i ' m sitting in a big puddle . it 's coming in all around me .
0	i mixed up ? i guess you are mixed up , if i do not belong to this camp , where do i belong ?
0	no . they came here to clean out the pony rider boys , i reckon , they did not expect to find me here . but when they saw me they could not let the opportunity go without taking a pot shot at me . i moved -- i stretched -- just at the right second , or i ' d have been a dead man before now .
0	no , neither is it natural for a dog to draw a sledge . but he does it -- when he has to . they ' re afraid of you , harry : that 's all .
0	that detective is loco , they returned to the house and found uncle nat disturbed over a visit from amos longworth . " why that man was quizzing me up just as if he thought _i_ stole the fan " !
0	over we go , boys ! but we must not waste those last grenades . let them have them .
0	that confirms my impression that fu-manchu was imposing upon the others ! i cannot conceive of a woman recluse from some lamaserie , surrounded by silent attendants and trained for her exalted destiny in the way that the legendary veiled woman of tibet is said to be trained , traveling alone in an english railway carriage ! did you observe , petrie , if her eyes were _oblique_ at all ?
0	the police ! take to your heels ! and this was the reply of the exchange . the police were hurrying to the spot . and lupin remembered the sounds which he had heard from the garden , four or five minutes earlier , at most :
0	you still here ? what are you waiting for ?
0	it shall never be said , that i stood silent while an insult was heaped upon ballymoy and the cause of nationalism in ireland .
0	your philosophy of life , fanny , is delightful . but if you do not hurry up with your dressing you will be late when the call boy comes . " but it would not exactly be a secret , " fanny pleaded , " it would just be something that it was no business of his to know " .
0	ha ! already standest there ? already standest there , o boniface ! by many a year the writing play ' d me false . so early dost thou surfeit with the wealth , for which thou fearedst not in guile to take the lovely lady , and then mangle her ? there stood i like the friar , that doth shrive a wretch for murder doom ' d , who e ' en when fix ' d , calleth him back , whence death awhile delays .
0	swelled chest , you mean , nobody has a better right . chunky is not half as big a fool as he ' d have everybody believe . when we think we are having lots of fun with him he 's really having sport with us . and those indians -- say , ned , do you think they will bother us any more ?
0	what is it ? we halted our horses in the water , permitting them to drink freely . some of the hunters , moving ahead of the rest , had climbed the high banks . we were attracted by their unusual exclamations . on looking upward , we perceived several of them standing on the top of a hill , and pointing to the north in an earnest and excited manner . could it be indians ?
0	hemanta , turn your wife out of the house immediately . hemanta was on the point of making a jest about punishments by reciting a verse from jayadeva , when the sound of an angry pair of slippers was heard approaching rapidly . they were the familiar footsteps of his father , haribar mukerji , and hemanta , not knowing what it meant , was in a flutter of excitement .
0	will they ever make you a great captain ! " would all the girls in st . florent crown you with bay leaves " ! jeered the cook .
0	no ! nor sail it . but after i had been on that voyage i could see us always like mice running close to a wall , forever and forever ! juan lepe , we are little and timid ! " we do not have to drink it " .
0	my god , lorna ! talk to him . make him stay .
0	i ' d a good reason to run the hosses up-hill -- thet 's what ! " what ' d you say " ? demanded creech .
0	just you notice the gravity of the beggars , not a smile on them . solemn as presbyterians . ' tention ! present ! recover ! not a lazy bone in their bodies . i say , collins : a person could make a perpetual motion , with a fly on a sort of a treadmill ? ah ! but then it would not pass muster unless it went of its own accord -- would it ? perpetual motion 's a thing i have been giving my attention to lately . you remember you advised me to study mechanics ? well , i have been thinking of arranging a clock so as to wind itself up as it went on . that 's one idea . another is a little more complicated . it 's a water-wheel , driving a pump that throws a stream into the race that feeds the water-wheel , so that you use the same water over and over again , and the whole concern 's self-acting . the idea came into my head like an inspiration . mind , i ' m telling you in confidence , for there 's a thousand notes hanging on to it .
0	oh , no , the happy-go-lucky is quite a stranger to me . you cherish up all its legends , though , i have no doubt . are there any tales of ghosts among them ? i can easily imagine certain disembodied spirits wandering through its narrow halls and up and down its winding staircases .
0	i invented it , " that 's a fine argument , " warde hollister said .
0	' tis not of the nor ' westers i give a thought , ridgar , for you well know that we of the company are above them , though it was but yesterday that an indian brought word of a trapper at isle a la crosse being maltreated in the woods by a couple of their sneaking cutthroats and two packs of beaver taken from him for which they laughingly offered him in payment a bundle of mangy skins cast out from the summer 's pickings . ' twas peter brins and i will wager that those two are marked for a long reckoning when the tables turn . and by the same indian i hear that the young blade from montreal with his light-haired brigade who stumbled upon us a while back , has reached his post on the saskatchewan and has taken hold with a high hand , doing his utmost to intercept our indians and turn the tide of the company 's furs into the trading-rooms of the nor ' westers . i think it will be a bootless process , for we hold our people with the hand of surety .
0	dot 's right , dot 's all right ! belle whispered to hopkins as squeaks retired . the chair nodded , rose and explained . " in drawing up our constitution , we deemed it best , in the interests of democracy , to do all voting by ballot and to exclude all proxies " .
0	take it ! take it , or i may change my mind !
0	all right , all right ! we hear yer . you need not ahoy so much .
0	splendid , eh ? so it is ! rather good fun , too , now we are on dry land . " a tornado ! i have been out in a tornado ! and how splendid it all is " !
0	your excellency , a courier from the king of prussia , from frankfort-on-the-main !
0	hurrah for our leader ! " i ' m proud of my green mountain boys , " he said , " and i shall be prouder still when we have won the victory " .
0	sure ! when my brave comes along with his blanket i will just step under , and then if anybody tries to take my man i will have the right to go on the warpath and have a scalping party that would be some satisfaction to the soul .
0	quit it ! jimmie and jack were lying behind a great flowing vine which swung from a balete tree , looking keenly out in the direction in which they believed the camp to be situated , when four lusty men who appeared to be filipinos crept noiselessly out of the jungle and sat down on their backs with chuckles of satisfaction .
0	i ' m willing to go on down the river now , " you ' re no better satisfied than we are , my friend , " rejoined the white hunter . leo extended his hand , and they shook hands all around .
0	how hun-like ! she turned her head again and favoured him with a stare . then she looked at the angry red mark on her wrists where the straps chafed .
0	it glorifies love as well as the petticoat , brissenden looked at him pityingly and admiringly . " you are so young , martin boy , so young . you will flutter high , but your wings are of the finest gauze , dusted with the fairest pigments . do not scorch them . but of course you have scorched them already . it required some glorified petticoat to account for that ' love-cycle , ' and that 's the shame of it " .
0	we can , by god ! it was a business sometimes really to hold her eyes , but they had , it must be said for her , their steady moments . she exchanged with vanderbank a somewhat remarkable look , then , with an art of her own , broke short off without appearing to drop him . " the thing is , do not you think " ? -- she appealed to mitchy -- " for us not to be so awfully clever as to make it believed that we can never be simple . we must not see too tremendous things -- even in each other " . she quite lost patience with the danger she glanced at . " we can be simple " !
0	they want to make terms , i reckon things are coming our way at last .
0	why , dolores , do not look like that , i did but wonder . if this were all gold , it could not enhance your worth in my eyes .
0	i see i am not expected to stay much longer . but really , miss holt , i do not quite see ` the pity ' of it . why am i not to know all that is going on as well as the rest ? besides , if your father had not told me , some one else would have done so . elizabeth rose and took the brush from its hook , and swept up the ashes and embers that had fallen upon the hearth . then she seated herself in her own low chair by the window , and took up her work , but laid it down again , and folded her hands on her lap .
0	what business is it of mine if you have compromised yourselves ? " but we have compromised ourselves and you will not , " shouted several voices .
0	no danger of that ! do not you think your uncle will be as anxious to see you as you are to see him ? " but what if he should go back before i got home " ? worried polly .
0	perhaps in a future existence , i shall be a great tragedian , and you a famous poet . meanwhile , i suppose , as your friend brian puts it , we are both sinning our mercies . after all , to live is the most important thing in life .
0	ruth thinks she ' d rather die quickly , than by slow degrees in being choked in this mud , " we can only die once , " responded ruth , sighing as she gazed down at the flooded road .
0	your practical mind naturally seeks a practical explanation , but i myself have other theories . then in addition to the charms of sedgemoor -- haunted sedgemoor -- on a fine day it is quite possible to see the ruins of glastonbury abbey from here ; and glastonbury abbey , as you may know , is closely bound up with the history of alchemy . it was in the ruins of glastonbury abbey that the adept kelly , companion of dr . dee , discovered , in the reign of elizabeth , the famous caskets of st . dunstan , containing the two tinctures .
0	the french coming to murder us ! " the beacon , uncle " ! said miss m ' intyre .
0	i do not suppose it would have made much difference to me , at that time . i was too fond of horse flesh , even from a boy , to be particular whose horse it was i got across . however , of course , after waiting till he had done , i gave the young scamp a blowing up .
0	yes , but we can not sit here laughing all the rest of the afternoon . marilla merritt will be here --
0	hurrah ! hurrah ! tom threw the rope again . this time it caught on a corner of the henhouse , and as he pulled the knot tight they had the floating house secure .
0	i expected you for luncheon , i ' m just going out now . if you ' re not in too great a hurry to go home you may go with me .
0	well , get it straight , say that a blundering german boy , who said he was a boy scout from philadelphia , nearly dragged me out of bed about midnight and informed me that other boy scouts were in trouble at the telegraph office . i knew that ned was expected here , and so lost no time in getting down . that 's all . the marines did the rest .
0	get the sheriff , or a sheriff 's officer ! be quick about it , one of you , please , and the rest of you stay here to help us .
0	you have such cold-blooded terms ! elle ne sait pas se conduire ; she ought to have come to ask about me .
0	beast of a woman ! you ghoul ! how dare you ! how dare you --
0	lousy fake ! stiffly he walked the length of the living room and returned to the regenerator .
0	men , listen ter me ! this here hai not no time fer squabblin ' amongst ourselves . we ' re all souths . tamarack spicer has done gone ter hixon , an ' got inter trouble . he 's locked up in the jail-house .
0	what a foolish little girl ! take it ; you will oblige me very much by taking it .
0	i would not care to be any stronger than i am , if i were any stronger folks would be saying that i ought to go to work .
0	you did very well on that one . the biologists have been curious about the animal since the day they saw one in a native camp . " yeah , " said bolden . " where 's the pet " ?
0	enough ! enough , i say ! am i not already killed with such bad talk , deafened with it , maddened with it every day from morn till night . ah , by the gospel , it has grown past bearing ! they will no longer make a priest of our iskender ; that honour is for the son of costant n ; -- low , cunning devil ! iskender may now , as a favour , sweep their house . here , in this very room , on yonder chair , the abandoned car l n sat and told me the fine news -- to me , the mainstay of the mission , who have not missed a prayer-meeting for twenty years --
0	you see ! our young men are early risers when it comes to pursuit of the fair . i must ride at once and see to the welfare of my daughter . she may be weeping at losing her escort so soon !
0	labour trouble , miss devereux , trouble in the labour market .
0	what happened ? the kneeling man was powerman first class fleck . mike recognized the man on the floor as powerman third class breckwell .
0	i knew i had not made a mistake , i knew him well enough . shut the door , jim . do not let him go .
0	you lie , you dirty pig ! but the little markgraf , still holding her on his knees , began to laugh , having become exceedingly exhilarated by the wine : " ah ! ah ! ah ! i never met any myself . as soon as they see us , they run away " .
0	master ! _master_ or _ma tre_ or _maestro_ or _magister_ according to the language you are speaking . now do you understand ?
0	perhaps your husband will be so amiable as to shampoo my cat ! she seems to like your ' salon ' !
0	not so much but that i will get over it , maybe i will pick up one or two of the fellows , anyway .
0	perhaps she does not want to . everyone does not , you know . " she is not exactly cross , but she is not the kind you can lean up against and say ' what a pretty tie you have on , ' as we did with miss ashurst . celia , i am afraid miss newman never will get married " .
0	splendid ! you ' re a little brick , josephine , and the best comrade in a canoe that i ever saw . now if we go over all i have got to do is to swim ashore with you . is it good walking to adare house ?
0	oh ! ow ! here , if you touch me i will cry for help .
0	what 's that ? was it herself you were spaking to in the dairy loft , grannie ?
0	oh ! you -- you must not be too -- too gay ! you know the patronesses have specified --
0	i did , crude as her manners seemed to him , richard was flattered . there could be no doubt that her interest was genuine .
0	oh , is she , indeed ? sister , do you know what mother annora is ?
0	hereward has right ! we will live and die fighting the french ! they were englishmen ; and they would rather die in their own merry england than conquer new kingdoms in the cold northeast . they were sworn , the leaders of them , to die or conquer , fighting the accursed frenchman . they were bound to st . peter , and to st . guthlac , and to st . felix of ramsey , and st . etheldreda the holy virgin , beneath whose roof they stood , to defend against frenchmen the saints of england whom they despised and blasphemed , whose servants they cast out , thrust into prison , and murdered , that they might bring in frenchmen from normandy , italians from the pope of rome . sweyn ulfsson spoke as became him , as a prudent and a generous prince ; the man who alone of all kings defied and fought the great hardraade till neither could fight more ; the true nephew of canute the king of kings : and they thanked him : but they would live and die englishmen .
0	well , i reckon i have and , after all , nobody is going to look at me and i do want to go . i will say yes and i can bulldoze mother into accepting , too , i am sure . i think it is the grandest thing that ever happened for all of you to be giving a debut party , and i ' m going to come , and what 's more , i intend to dance every dance . " well , you ' d look better than most even if you did , " put in colonel crutcher , " but you need not be coming the flora mcflimsey on us . do not we see you running around here in a blue dress all the time ? and if that ai not good enough i bet you have got a white muslin somewhere with a blue sash and maybe a blue hair ribbon " .
0	how simple , another moment found me at the top of the partition wall again with the boy beside me . unbuckling my harness i snapped it together with a single long strap which i lowered to the waiting xodar below . he grasped the end and was soon sitting beside us .
0	what on earth could i do with real lace in the mountains of peru ? " we-e-e-ell , " began mrs . milo , appraising the gown at more length ; " is not it rather simple , my dear , -- for a girl whose father is as wealthy as yours ? somehow i expected at least a little real lace " .
0	oh , no ! of course we would not want father to be given away as a toy ! but this stuffed elephant -- oh , i just love him !
0	gentlemen ! i turned again to the local talent .
0	boat , ahoy ! if the waif was not dead , it was hardly necessary to lower a boat to send to his relief ; at least not till it appeared that he needed assistance .
0	you think of nothing but fighting , bear of the north seas . " never mind " ! as if it was a calamity over which he was bound to comfort the mother . " if she is half as beautiful as you look at this moment , what splintering of lances there will be about her ! how jolly , to see the lads hewing at each other , while our daughter sits in the pavilion , as queen of love " !
0	fine pair of fools ye will make ! " small thanks to you , " growled buckrow .
0	well , i will tell you , then . i think byron was mistaken . my experience is , that , when a man is in love , there 's nothing else of him . that 's the reason i have kept out of it altogether of late years . my advice is , do not fall in love : it takes too much time . but about corresponding , now ; you have not said whether you would write to me , or not . will you ?
0	perhaps you will think so , for there certainly are few idle minutes with us .
0	why ? i ' m sure i do not know , except because they always have , and i suppose always will , while there 's a university at leiden . that 's all we will see , but it is not all there is to see . by-and-by the procession will go prancing back to the club , where the next thing will be to get over the big reading-table , then over the buffet of the bar , without once breaking the chain of coat-tails , through passages and kitchens to the club-room once more , where the chain will be split up , but where the chairs in which the men will sit to drink champagne and eat the nougat tart , must be _on_ the tables and not round them .
0	first , he is handsome ; next , he is a _rangatira_ , well-born , as my husband ought to be . i really do not know his name . ca not you guess that is what i have come to find out ? " and which is _the_ particular one , your treasure trove ? of course , he will marry you as soon as the water is out of his ears , and make you happy ever afterwards " .
0	bear up , old man ! do not grudge me a fraction of the wits i live by . were not you trying to give me an inkling yesterday ? under a glance as direct as the question roy reddened furiously . the ' dear old boy ' had done more than suspect ; he had seen through the whole show -- the indignity of all others that youth can least abide .
0	not thus am i , i see no path but those her feet have worn ; my roof-tree is the shadow of her hair , and the light breaking through her long despair the only sunrise that mine eyelids crave ; for doubly dead without me in the grave is she who , if my feet had gone before , had found life dark as death 's abhorred shore .
0	i am sure they will , will you excuse us ?
0	yes , yes -- i ' m here -- not all right exactly , but i will be all right _some day_ , you may depend upon that ! " hallo ! nigel " ! came at that moment from the other side of the obstruction , " are you there -- all right " ?
0	here i am ! " field-marshal " ! shouted a voice at a distance . " field-marshal blucher , where are you " ?
0	huh ; you will be wanting it worse than ever if we do , " well , you have got it all ; i ' m busted wide open , except for a measly dollar , an ' i shore hopes you do not want that , " he laughed . " you play a whole lot better than you did the last time i was here . i have got to move along . i ' m going east an ' see wallace an ' from there i have got to meet red an ' ride home with him . but you come an ' see us when you can -- it 's _me_ that wants revenge this time " .
0	if the real estate men of gridley knew of this place , they ' d buy up the ground around here and then sell bungalows at fancy prices to amateur fishermen of means .
0	whoo ! you and yer hints , joe ! how long past have ye come around me with ' em ! ' i b ' lieve ye c ' d make more money , mike ' -- that 's the way ye ' d put it , -- ' if ye altered the beach a bit . make a little country-side restaurant of it , ' ye ' d say , ' and have good cookin ' , and keep the boys and girls from raisin ' so much hell out there . soon ye ' d have other people comin ' beside the regular crowd . make a little garden on the shore , and let ' em eat at tables under trees an ' grape-arbors -- ' joe looked at him sharply . " do not you think my old notion of what might be done could be made to pay " ?
0	that your father blew up _la libert _ ? of course not . he said that was absurd . but , just the same , he thought it unwise to talk about it .
0	there is also , perhaps , a kind of intangible sense of a liberty taken . i ' m bound to say i think wildmay was decidedly at his ease . to appropriate in that cool fashion the personality of a total stranger ! but artists are the most unprincipled folk unhung . ils prennent leur bien la , ou ils le trouvent .
0	is thee calling the rich an excrescence ? " what strange excrescences do grow up on our so-called civilization , " he said .

0	hallo , hallo ! seize the young traitor , in the name of the emperor and the governor ! " behold where the young villain stands , " exclaimed a third , pointing to philip .
0	oh , is it ? i ' m a selfish beast to be glad , but i am . i was feeling quite low in my mind and ' out of it ' at dinner .

0	there comes the planter ! his carbine was in condition for immediate use , and he had taken a revolver from the horse he had ridden belonging to the trooper who had perished in the river . the noise up-stairs continued , and he had become somewhat impatient for the appearance of the rest of the party . he was inclined to " open the ball ; " but he concluded that it would be a piece of rashness for him to do so , and he refrained from doing anything . between the door and the safe he obtained a full view of the head of the staircase .
0	stand by to let go the anchor , " hee ! hee " ! observed poopy .

0	it would not be wonderful if you forgot even your names , considering all the excitement that was going on when we got here . but we ' re all right now , i guess .
0	i will spit the first man that draws a blade , and stop they did ; no one could mistake the crackling authority in that voice . the commander , unseen in the moving , dim light , had been circling the periphery of the camp , to make sure that all was well . he strode toward the two younger men , who stood silently , shocked into immobility . the commander 's sword was already in his hand .
0	you need not be so unkind , paul . what did i ever do for you much more than snub you ? we boys and girls ; there is not so much difference between us : we love our masters . yet you must not think so poorly of me . i was only a child to him then , but we were locked up in paris together during the entire siege . have not you heard ? he did take a little notice of me there , paul , i assure you . " but he never seemed to take much notice of you , " i said .
0	dear me ! you give very bad accounts of shakespeare 's land ! it must be very sad !

0	you must forgive my ignorant praise , i have always thought it beautiful : but i can understand that an artist is never satisfied .
0	so that i can help build the new heaven and the new earth , " because i liked you , " she answered quietly , and suddenly it struck vane , almost with a feeling of surprise , that the girl sitting beside him was more than attractive . he wondered why he had let her slip so easily out of his life . and the train of thought once started seemed a not unpleasant one . . . . " you will get it back soon , derek -- your sense of proportion . you have got to " .
0	the skirt will cover that . i guess i was sleepy . she dressed swiftly , he lounging on the sofa and watching her . he loved to watch her dress , she did it so gracefully , and the motions brought out latent charms of her supple figure . " you ' re not so sure-fingered tonight as usual , " said he . " i never saw you make so many blunders -- and you have got one stocking on wrong side out " .

0	come aboard , you -- you lunatic ! by this time the commotion in the river was frightful , and the captain 's steering , as he went on his round again , something marvellous to behold . a strange lack of sympathy on the part of brother captains added to his troubles . every craft he passed had something to say to him , busy as they were , and the remarks were as monotonous as they were insulting . at last , just as he was resolving to run his boat straight down the river until he came to a halt for want of steam , the mate caught the rope he flung , and the bulldog went down the river with her boat made fast to her stern .

0	yes ; but you do not think of the situations in clelia , and what i can do with her , i see a song there that would light up all london . unfortunately , the sentiment 's dead radical . it would not so much matter if we were certain to do camillus as well ; because one would act as a counterpoise to the other , you know . well , follow your own fancy . camillus is strictly classical . i treat opera there as alfieri conceived tragedy . clelia is modern style . cast the die for camillus , and let 's take horse . only , we lose the love-business -- exactly where i show my strength . clelia in the camp of the king : dactyllic chorus-accompaniment , while she , in heavy voluptuous anapaests , confesses her love for the enemy of her country . remember , this is our romantic opera , where we do what we like with history , and make up our minds for asses telling us to go home and read our ' student 's rome end_sentence_quote then that scene where she and the king dance the dactyls , and the anapaests go to the chorus . sublime ! let 's go into the woods and begin . we might give the first song or two to-night . in composition , mind , always strike out your great scene , and work from it -- do not work up to it , or you have lost fire when you reach the point . that 's my method .

0	imagine big , good-natured roderick stirred sufficiently to lay hands on any one ! " yes -- when he had recovered himself sufficiently . i thought , at first , his anger was going to choke him " .
0	and mine 's shoe-hockeys -- the best ever ! and an air rifle and books too !
0	in that case , mrs . spofford , we should not have existed at all . " i daresay i do think more of the past than of the present , mr . percival . you are right about the future . it is a blank page , to be glorified or soiled by what is set down upon it . fate has thrown you two together . perhaps it was so written in the past that you despise . a single turn of the mysterious wheel of fortune brought you into her life . half a turn , -- the matter of minutes , -- and you would never have seen each other , and you would have gone your separate ways to the end of time without even knowing that the other existed . no doubt you both contend that you cannot live without each other . it is the usual wail of lovers . but are you quite as certain in your minds that you would have perished if you had never seen each other " ?
0	i can not make him understand , " run down and tell hendrik to see that there 's plenty of water , " said alb . " it will not do for the motor to get hot . say to him that we ' re going to have a race " .

0	howl me , or i will sthrike , an ' we will have a death in the house .
0	smash the door down ! yet his voice could not much more than be heard above the racket that sounded below . anson dalton and his seven rough men were raising a hubbub , indeed .
0	is not it ? well , _it_ may not be . but how about yourself ? " of course ! you do not take it for a joke , do you " ?
0	you have started my baseball blood to boiling , but i think i will keep my head cool and not play .
0	nothing but nonsense ? what ? what ? what d ' ye say ? d ' ye mean to tell me that keneally does not know what he 's talkin ' about ?
0	you lie ! you are deceiving us , and think to escape with life , and pocket your stealing . i tell you , if the money is not forthcoming , i will hang you like dogs . tie them up and lash them to a tree ; i will give them a short time to think the matter over .
0	if la pompadour could hear you , she would understand why i prefer the live amusing lion to the dead dog . when you are gone , i shall be inconsolable . i am a born inquisitor . " so much so , " rejoined i , " as to be intrusive " .
0	i know the one you mean , " well , " he proceeded , " that dame was so outrageously made up that you could have used her face for a danger signal -- on the level you could -- and yet i will bet she was so old it would break a fellow just to buy candles for her birthday cake " .
0	stop ! seize the impostor !
0	unhand me , baron dangloss ! this is an outrage ! " if we are caught " ! cried anguish . " why , what have we done " ?
0	that is not a very definite charge . you surely do not hold him responsible for the death of that striker ? " i have no legal proof , but i know it just the same " .
0	give ' em till to-morrow night ! what you goin ' to do then ?
0	ah ! i fear , monsieur biddulph , that you are displeased with me . i have annoyed you by not satisfying your natural curiosity . but were i to do so , it would be against my own interests . hence my silence . am i not perfectly honest with you ?
0	well , that ruins me , do you understand ? i will not make fifty cents . make ! why , i will owe , -- i will be -- be -- that ruins me , do you understand ?
0	it has struck me , that perhaps you do not want us in these woods , anyway .
0	ross , for heaven 's sake ! " so that is where the shoe pinches ! elinor , dearest , methinks there is one of your friends ' daughters who has no sort of attraction for our daughter . but arethusa , my child , i told you , when you first mentioned his name , that he was in a class apart . i told you that he was no lonely floweret wasting his sweetness on the desert air , and that the competition where you would compete was keen . i told you " .
0	then the dervishes will riot after all ! " the germans in stamboul , " he said , " talked too loud of this place in my hearing " . i stood gnawing a loaf already , and i urged him to take one , but he would eat nothing until all the men should have been fed . " they detrain dervish troops at this point , " said he , " and march them to the shore to be shipped to gallipoli , because they riot and make trouble if kept in barracks in skutari or stamboul . this bread was intended for two train-loads of them " .
0	the deer finished the story better than we ever could , " wait , mr . gilroy ; julie never finished her story . she broke off just where the beast bellowed -- then came the buck " ! said joan .

0	what an _enfant terrible_ you are , my dear ! of course i have been -- hundreds of times . moya looked straight at her . " were you ever in love in your life " ?
0	well , the money you give away has got to come from some source , has not it ? and you manipulate the stock market and put through wheat corners and all that , and catch the poor people and take their money from them ! charity is love . but your idea of charity makes me pity you . up here i find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by stifling competition , by debauching legislatures , by piracy and legalized theft , and then give a tenth of it to found a university , and so atone for his crimes . that is called charity . oh , i know a lot about such things ! i have been studying and thinking a great deal since i came to the united states . " my dear little girl , " he said in a patronizing tone , " do not you think you are assuming a great deal ? i ' m sure i ' m not half so bad as you paint me " .
0	well , i hope he will not stick pins into you , duchess , " our host is rather horrid this evening , " answered the duchess , colouring . " i believe he thinks that monmouth married me on purely scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly " .
0	there was no one hidden anywhere in your chambers ? " i came in , as i said , " explained west , " about eleven o ' clock and having made some notes relating to an interview arranged for this morning , i locked the plans in the safe and turned in " .
0	that would be a long time . " i wish i could make the walk so slow that we could spend a life-time on the road " .
0	we are all ready and willing , " i suppose you are more ready and willing than the boys who pull the boat " .
0	what 's the decision ? " time ! break away " ! yelled tad horner , forcing himself over between the combatants . " it 's all over " .
0	we will pay for the ride ! " will you take us on " ? cried peter , hurrying with his companions as fast as he could , for the boat as " bringing to " some distance ahead . " will you take us on " ?
0	because she 's sol peterkin 's daughter ? will quivered as if the words struck him like a whip .
0	that 's because we ' re young , " that 's another joke , " laughed hal in a low voice , as soon as kelly had stepped out of hearing . " here 's a man like kelly , with fairly long service to his credit , but he 's a private still , and probably always will be . if the colonel made him a corporal , kelly would not rest until he had the chevrons taken from his sleeve so that he could be a private soldier again . now you and i , noll , work like blazes all the time , and win our promotion , yet kelly considers us only boys , and boys who do not know much , either . either one of us can take kelly out in a squad and work him until he runs rivers of perspiration , and he can not talk back without danger of being disciplined . yet all the time , kelly , under our orders , is thinking of us , half contemptuously , as boys who do not really know anything about soldiering " .
0	i dare say dobson is a rough diamond . there 's worse folk in the world all the same , but i do not think he will want to stay . he only went there to pass the time till he heard from his brother in vancouver . he 's a roving spirit , and will be off overseas again . " he 's not that . and i do not like the innkeeper either . i would want him shifted " .
0	let 's go ! carr hesitated , resisting the impulse to take mado at his word . he looked around . the landing stage had been deserted , but people now were approaching . people not to be tolerated at the moment . he saw courtney davis , grim and determined . there ' d be more arguments , useless but aggravating . well , why not go ? he ' d decided to break away . what better chance ? suddenly he dived for the manhole of mado 's vessel ; wriggled his way to the padded interior of the air-lock . he heard the clang of the circular cover . mado was clamping it to its gasketed seat .
0	how strange that seems ! i suppose i shall get used to it . but in town we seem never to have a whole day for a day 's work ; we always have to do part of it at night , or the next morning . do you ever have a day here that 's too large a size for its work ? " oh , we have the whole day for our work , " she answered , tolerantly .
0	only another fifty feet ! come on .
0	she 's little , but she has plenty of independence and energy , hurrah , girls , there 's wayne hall just ahead of us .
0	do not you mind mr . putney , doctor ! " no , there 's nobody sick here , in one sense , " said putney , when the doctor had greeted the ladies . " but . we want your advice all the same . mrs . munger is in a pretty bad way morally , doc " .
0	this thing ? why , it 's just an old junk we use for a station wagon .
0	say , do not wish such an experience on any of us !
0	all right , old rooster ! it is your play now , and i give you your turn ! down with your best card !
0	it 's nothing , just a scratch .
0	this can not last long ! singular climate ! this is too much ! there is nothing to help us , without speaking of these sharp crystals which cut my face . halloo , captain ! at the end of five minutes he said to himself , --
0	bring forward the guns ! the elevation was increased ; still the bolts fell short .
0	stop that or i will knock your head off , " is it you , sam ? well , you _are_ in a nice fix " ! and ben 's eyes began to twinkle with mischievous merriment , as well they might , for sam certainly was a spectacle to convulse the soberest person . perched unsteadily on the gnarled stump , with his muddy legs drawn up , his dismal face splashed with mud , and the whole lower half of his body as black as if he had been dipped in an inkstand , he presented such a comically doleful object that ben danced about , laughing like a naughty will-o ' -the-wisp who , having led a traveler astray , then fell to jeering at him .
0	a hit ! a palpable hit ! it was mrs . grimes 's turn to wince .
0	i ' m damned if yer do , yer do not pay for nothinks , but der childers shall go , or my name ai not blunkers .
0	there 's only smoke overhead , there are not any stars .
0	and a man who tells him to shoot is another , " a man who shoots at a whale with a rifle is a thundering fool " ! he observed .
0	that is sufficiently expressed ! but , with the autumn and the academy in session , the town seemed very much alive . we sampled ' cheney 's best , ' wegard 's cakes , and saw the custard-and-cream chapel .
0	well , what were you doing there ? amazed by the accuracy of his information and awed by his tone , the girl struggled for an answer , while the audience waited as at a crisis in a powerful play .
0	pronounce thy wishes , o peach of the west , we rechristen thee queen of the south .
0	i s ' d think she does not want touching with a prop , i should not .
0	talk to us in english , mr . scott , " i will try to remember that decimal as you have done , " replied louis . " now , mr . scott , do not open bowditch 's navigator to us , or talk about projection , '' logarithms , '' gunter , ' and ' inspection ; ' for i am not capable of understanding them , for my trigonometry has gone to the weeping willows " .
0	you will , will you ? " woof , woof " ! barked spotty .
0	in a way , i paint signs -- and i try to do them artistically .
0	' tis the devil-fish ! a long , snake-like arm was lifted out of the water . it swayed this way and that , darted here and there , and fell back with a splash . the moving spots , now plainly gigantic eyes , glittered .
0	lemo -- lemo -- ice cold lemonade -- five cents a glass ! " remember , " adjured a second unseen , " one price admits you to all parts of the big show " !
0	so here is where they boast of excitement ? and yet a man must make it himself .
0	talk from there , " come here " ! yelled joe . " i want to talk to yer " .
0	no , no ; to not shoot ! " white bay stop or big wolf shoot " ! bellowed tom , drawing forth a rusty pistol he had picked up in the barn . this rusty pistol had done lots of duty at fun-making before .
0	it 's the only way to govern boys or soldiers , then both boy and soldier will keep their promises to you .
0	where are both of yours ? " ' t-t-t-was all your fault , " roared kit . " y-y-you began it ! anyway , where is your new wooden shoe " ?
0	that is a good suggestion . i wonder if some of our orators ever read themselves over in cold blood . the back numbers of the record ought to be a solemn warning . " i hope you will make a speech on the subject that will look well in the record , " said north , with some sarcasm .
0	heave-to , or i will sink you , " speak your own mother tongue and i will answer ye , " replied disco .
0	well , let them , we do not want any of their troubles in the west . what do you say to an afternoon 's nutting ?
0	so you have not told your father ? i was sure you had taken him into your confidence by this time . but i reckon it 's a mighty good thing that you did not -- for your father . like as not if you ' d tell him he ' d get some riled and come right over to see me , yearning for my blood . and then i ' d have to shoot him up some . and that would sure be too bad -- you loving him as you do .
0	you are a prejudiced beggar , skinner , you know very well he is not an ass , and i am not at all sure he is affected . i suppose it is the way he has been brought up . there is no saying what you might have been yourself if you had had nurses and people about you who always insisted on your turning out spick-and-span . well , easton , what have you been doing with yourself since we saw you last ?
0	damnation ! if they have done for him , i will do for them !
0	naturally , a bottle of kavass , my peach of turkistan , and a glass for our comrade .
0	you thought it would be more like the hoover farm , did not you ? well , of course that 's only our house , and dad built a nice one , on the finest piece of land he could find , because we were going to spend a good deal of time there . there 's electric light and running water in all the rooms and we ' re just as comfortable there as we would be in the city .
0	oh ! yes there are , lots of them too , but you can only see them in the dark , and it 's good and dark down in that deep well .
0	it does seem absurd . sometimes when i pass him jogging along to town in his rickety old cart , and look at his pale , cruel face , and know that he is a broken-down gambler and man of the world , and yet considers himself infinitely superior to me a young man in the prime of life , with a good constitution and happy prospects , it makes me turn away to hide a smile . miss laura was laughing merrily . " how funny that sounds , harry . so he despises you , " and she glanced at her good-looking cousin , and his handsome buggy and well-kept horse , and then burst into another merry peal of laughter .
0	i am sure you do not , " i do not " ! said archelaus firmly ; " begging your pardon , miss marvin " .
0	i must have detective instincts myself , i had already thought of the same lie .
0	she 's ashore already , i caught his arm as he was raising it to batter his poor devoted head , and shook it violently .
0	hold , madam , leave the girl alone . i agree with his lordship , no woman shall be coerced on account of me .
0	i ' m one kind of red -- not the kind that sold russia to the boche -- but i ' m very , very red . " nonsense , " said brisson , " you ' re not a red " !
0	all right , i will , " save them , " shouted roy .
0	do not shoot , father ! " stand out from behind my daughter , you coward , " shouted grand .
0	i should not else have understood yours so well , come , my -- miss wedderburn , if you are ready .
0	you might have done me the service of not excusing yourself to the squire when he came here , in such a way as to implicate me . " oh , fifty -- that is , just now . more like a thousand when i get to town . and where it 's to come from ! but never mind . ' pon my soul , i pity the fox i run down here . i feel i ' m exactly in his case in london . however , if i can do you any service , ned -- "
0	want a job ? what can you do ?
0	this summer the marchesa pontini has organized a sort of club , which meets in the villa every day except sundays . three days the meeting is in the morning , three days in the afternoon . the silliest people of the aristocracy belong to this club , and the marchesa is the mother goose . ecco ! will you come , or -- or have you some appointment ? " che diavolo ! what 's that " ?
0	oh , my best bib and tucker ! sent to the cleaner 's this morning , all green stains at the back !
0	we have been protecting the face of nature , the only way to get that gang out of the engine house was to set fire to something . tommy wanted to burn up the railroad station , because he does not like the new york and new haven , and fred was for setting fire to judge allen 's house , because he was rude to beatrice . but we finally formed the village improvement society , organized to burn all advertising signs . you know those that stood in the marshes , and hid the view from the trains , so that you could not see the sound . we chopped them down and put them in a pile , and poured gasolene on them , and that fire is all that is left of the pickles , fly-screens , and pills .
0	i am afraid you have not read your guide-book since you came into germany , perhaps it has not occurred to you that a german mile is equal to about four and two thirds english miles .
0	you said it ! a lot of greasers rode in just now , started shootin ' up promiscus like , and in the excitement del pinzo and his crowd managed to get out of the calaboose ! we got to get a new one , i reckon ! but come on ! we may land ' em yet !
0	remember , prescott , nothing but a win !
0	i do not think i will drop you . " how the deuce , " said i , " am i going to get out " ?
0	never mind the letters , tell me why you keep her there .
0	has not he the colossal nerve though ? why , i know for a dead certainty that the boats were at least three lengths apart at the time . that sure does make me snicker , brad .
0	yes , that 's the goods , up with the bully !
0	whoa ! whoa ! hold up ! who 's the hussy , sister bogart ? sit down and take it cool and tell us about it .
0	you ' re crazy , what 's the answer to it ?
0	that is very uncourteous , master edgar , a good knight should hold the weight of a lady to be as light as that of a down pillow .
0	she tells me that you have a very good seat . " what heresy , particularly in a society doctor ! but i agree with you . i learned to ride on her account , you know . as a matter of fact , i hate it . the sight of a horse fills me with terror " .
0	ha , i told you he was yellow ! somebody 's cut away one edge of the stays ' l . now we have got ' em !
0	the antidote ! give me the other box -- quick !
0	he could not ? and what about me ? could i help myself ?
0	i have you , man or devil ! halt , and take quarter !
0	charlot has often told me so , some in that noble company nudged one another , and one there was who burst into a loud guffaw .
0	book -- book -- book ! pocket-book ! if thee can not read , thee knows what a book is , thee gawney !
0	do not let that worry you ! notoriety is what keeps baseball where it is to-day , and if it was not for the free advertising we get in the newspapers there would not be the attendance that brings in the dollars , and lets us travel in a private car . do not be afraid of boosting yourself . the reporters will help you , and be glad to . they have to get the stuff , and often enough it 's hard to do , especially at the training camp .
0	what , sir ! you come to disturb me here ? some important event , then , has taken place ?
0	host ! host ! where is that fellow who was to pay my reckoning ?
0	helen said she might be invited to dance the german after all . dear paul 's mamma has a grease with a first classman , " you are not leaving us out . we understand that even the little mother can not ask her boys to take a girl to the german ! but we are not likely to pine away with all the other fun afoot , " cried natalie gaily , doing a pirouette across the room just by way of relieving pent-up anticipation .
0	damn it ; so you knew he ' d do it ! do not deny it ; you have admitted it . you knew he ' d hang himself , and yet .
0	i say where 's allstone , the scoundrel ? " hey " ?
0	it means , ' i bring peace ' ! miss copley told us that . it belongs to her .
0	she does ; but it 's one of those you operate with your feet . " do not tell me she plays the piano " !
0	just now , you had better sew carpet-rags . " i like housekeeping . you just go from one thing to another . i will have some one to cook and peel potatoes and all that . and we will keep a horse and waggon , and i shall go to ride every day " .
0	cheese ! cheese with tea ! " some cheese " .
0	ye will not , ye will not go along until ye mend your manners .
0	easily , why , bonnie , aileen , this becomes more and more mysterious and interesting .
0	come here , you young rascal ! the captain ordered the sailors to stop him ; but either because they were not smart enough , or because they had no relish for the business , they failed to catch him , and the culprit ran out on the bowsprit . the angry man followed him as far as the bowsprit bitts , but prudence forbade his going any farther .
0	why not ? you seem to think i may need a guardian .
0	if you were not a stranger , you would know that saving cutlers ' lives is my hobby , and one in which i am steadily resisted and defeated , especially by the cutlers themselves : why , i look upon you as a most considerate and obliging young man for indulging me in this way . if you had been a hillsborough hand , you would insist upon a brain-fever , and a trip to the lunatic asylum , just to vex me , and hinder me of my hobby . at this henry was all obedience , and indeed thanked him , with the tears in his eyes , for his kindness to a poor stranger .
0	how do you think ? i schemed it out for a whole day , all on that five shillings you made me keep . i meant you to have it , and you see you have had to , after all . jimmy was so full of his conversation with kelly that he had forgotten all about lalage 's promised surprise which was awaiting him at the flat . true , he hurried back , but she saw at once that it was to tell her his news , and not to find out what she had prepared for him ; in fact , he sat down at the table , and was about to carve , before it struck him that the dinner was an unusually elaborate one ; then , " how on earth did you manage it , sweetheart " ? he asked .
0	hello ! anybody thinking of going to the circus !
0	we ' re not in the south , david . " i did not know we used that word in the south ' sir " .
0	yes . i hated it at first , but she asked if i could give her any real reason why the cook should be called by her first name more than the seamstress or governess . i tried to say that it was shorter , but she smiled and said that in this case it was longer ! -- her name is diantha -- i have seen it on letters . and it is one syllable longer . anyhow i have got used to miss bell now . " makes you call her " miss bell " all the time , does she " ?
0	not only care but paper and ink , " not only does the government printing office do a vast amount of printing for the use of the washington authorities but it does a great deal of work for the country at large . think , for instance , of the care and accuracy that goes into making out the united states census " .

0	oh , we saw a photograph of sallie ; and if celia looks anything like mr . si snubbins , we can not mistake her , let 's run over and go in .
0	nonsense ! " well , " he said , " if you do not believe me , what she 's like , would you believe she has been confirmed three times " ?
0	ah , you thief , you false prophet ! madariaga looked at him slyly . " going to leave , eh ? . . . what for " ? but in vain he repeated his questions . the frenchman was floundering through a series of incoherent explanations -- " i ' m going ; i have got to go " .
0	do not throw it ! tie a rope to it first !
0	you get out o ' here ! william leaped to his feet ; this was something he could not bear ! he made a bloodthirsty dash toward the gate , which the singer was just in the act of passing .
0	if one was to speak to me , i know i ' d have a duck-fit .
0	and mr . trent shall be the black woman who pushes you all about ! we screamed with joy ! the rich man jumped when we screamed . the rich man 's name was mr . trent .
0	a gentleman with whom our friend rupert had a difference of opinion , there is a blood feud between them . seriously , the fellow has a grudge against our friend , and as he is the sort of man to gratify himself without caring much as to the means he uses , i should advise master holliday not to trust himself out alone after dark . there are plenty of ruined men in these german regiments who would willingly cut a throat for a guinea , especially if offered them by one of their own officers .
0	i do not know how much miss lettie has been talking about me , full and plenty , i expect .
0	originally that might have been the reason , but i have an idea that the boys --
0	in any man but you , romayne , i should call that affectation . " no ; something i do not quite understand . one does not expect to find any embarrassment in the manner of a well-bred woman . and yet she seemed to be embarrassed when she spoke to me . perhaps i produced an unfortunate impression on her " .
0	never mind ! we need not discuss mr . gray 's antecedents . how old are you ?
0	but you did not , good boy ! stick to that just as long as you wish to keep a place in athletics .
0	you will not get much , this roll is just enough to be pleasant .
0	shave ! and if you ' re more than five minutes on the job i will carve my initials in you with your razor .
0	oh , dear ! oh , dear ! where has she gone ?
0	have you heard from t . branch ? " well -- i have had things on my mind " . her blue eyes met his , and she flushed a bit . " not things that i am sorry for , but things that i am worried about . but now -- well , i am very happy in my heart , daddy " .
0	a few ranches , roads , and cornfields would make a difference ? well , they follow the steel in canada and it 's my job to clear the way . but the soft look promises warmer weather , and bob will get ahead if a chinook wind begins to blow . i imagine he has not done very much the last few days . " very still . everything has a soft look ; the harsh glitter 's gone and the air has not the sting it had . somehow the calm 's majestic . the pictures one sees of the mountains hardly give a hint ; one feels this is the grandest country in the world , but it looks strangely unfinished " .
0	all ready ? a race had been arranged between the boys , and dick was one of the contestants . the distance was from one end of the cove to the other was a little over three-quarters of a mile . there were ten starters , including fred , frank , larry , and mumps . mumps had a reputation as a skater , gained at his home on the hudson river .
0	thank god , thank god ! " because it is not true " .
0	let us believe we can , and wait and see .
0	i believe you to be the biggest rascal in town , get out , or i will not answer for myself . ladies are not to be treated in this manner .
0	that 's putting a bit of a strain on me , but i know you must have a good reason , sis . only remember , when you want help , you have not any friend like your own ' buddy end_sentence_quote
0	smiles -- my smiles -- are not so valuable , i ' m afraid -- except to you , perhaps , billy dimpled and shook her head .
0	just a second , then -- there she is , taylor !
0	hey there , dray ! you ' re out of the course . get in from shore !
0	this one -- " what coin , judy " ? asked tommy , curiously .

0	why , hiram , you ' re not thinking of smugglers .
0	i will say that he may stay here on trial -- while we ' re in the country . but , oh , dear -- i had hoped we ' d never have another dog -- and of all things , a long-haired dog ! " well , mother -- do not you think billy deserves the dog " ? said mr . lee when billy had finished . and keineth whispered , " goody , goody " !
0	oh , the logic -- ! " oh , i say it -- but has not my whole point been that i do not ask you to . therefore , " she demanded -- but smiling at him now -- " where 's the logic " ?
0	well , no . we have only got this summer to go up the missouri and back , so , maybe as rob did when he enlisted for eighteen , we will have to smouch a little ! " a year ! two years " !

0	to the point ! make for ' long point ! ' down to the shore of the pond they hurried . sure enough , the little susan was gone . charlie , in opposition to mr . bunker 's command , had gone aboard and , sitting amidships , had rocked her to and fro until her painter had got loose , and the wind , which blew off shore , had drifted the boat out on to the pond , where she was now visible , with charlie 's head just above the bulwarks , steadily setting down towards a a point about a mile distant .

0	that 's a rocket , you blamed old fool ! " i intend to have every officer on that steamer arrested for criminal negligence the instant i set foot in new york , " boomed the banker .

0	aye , they will be anxious enough . mak ' sure o ' that , " you can not help it , " she said , with mild decision . " when there are daughters and a new gentleman comes into a big property in the neighborhood , it 's nothing but natural that the mothers should be a bit anxious " .

0	it would not be a bad dream for you , the charming young lady is thirty years old , it is true , but she has an income of eighty thousand livres . she is adorably capricious , and her style of beauty wears well . coralie is a silly little fool , my dear boy , well enough for a start , for a young spark must have a mistress ; but unless you make some great conquest in the great world , an actress will do you harm in the long run . now , my boy , go and cut out conti . here he is , just about to sing with camille maupin . poetry has taken precedence of music ever since time began .

0	you ' re quite welcome , mr . ross , but what was the shooting about ?
0	oh , i have nothing new to say about them . everybody has said it , from ecclesiastes to tolstoi . " what 's the matter with ' all the people i know , ' " she challenged him explicitly .

0	oh , dear , here comes that mean , disagreeable tim roon . he 's the hatefulest boy !
0	discontented , is it , and do you know why , boy ?
0	all right . stay here . take care of the fire . if the pot boils , let it ; if it does not , throw a bit of coal into the flames . reverte ! reverte ! let him remain here .
0	ah ! the one man who stayed was a clever man . when the prahu from batchian came here he said he was sick , and that his wife feared to sail so far in a small prahu . he would wait , he said , till a ship came . " why did the two others remain " ? asked mr . dacre .
0	here ! what you tryin ' to do ? controlling himself , orme hurried quickly to the nearest elevator . he had timed his action ; the starter was just about to close the door as he hurried in . but quick though he was , alcatrante was close behind him . the agile south american squeezed into the elevator by so close a margin that the door caught his coat .
0	ah , it was better that you should do that than i !

0	there 's one thing she did not tell you , john is a paroled convict . twenty-eight years ago , in hot blood , he killed a man in a quarrel over sixty-five cents . he 's been out of prison with the hales three years now . you remember louis , the old frenchman , on my place ? he 's another . so that 's settled . when your two come -- of course you will pay them fair wages -- and we will make sure they ' re the same nationality , either chinese or italians -- well , when they come , john , with their help , and under mr . hale 's guidance , will knock together a small cabin for them to live in . we will select the spot . even so , when your farm is in full swing you will have to have more outside help . so keep your eyes open , billy , while you ' re gallivanting over the valley .

0	something a little less ambitious will have to do , i think . after another night march we shall be on the spot , and can get to work . corporal shaw held out his hand .

0	it 's a lie ! " what i say is true , " he said quietly , as he noted the look of uncertainty on their faces . " you can easily tell by investigating " .
0	is well enough . you will see many a bandaged arm before the twenty-four hours are up ; few of us finish without a scratch or strain or blister . this is a man 's game , but it 's not half so destructive as foot-ball . you wished me good luck for the georgia race ; will you repeat the honor before i go back to ffrench ?
0	well , as to that , i do not know that i will refuse . " but surely you will take a little drop of brandy or liqueur " ?
0	i do not want to hear mr . fellingham 's comparisons , van diemen strode round the drawing-room with his hands in his pockets . " there 's a disparity of ages , " he said , abruptly , as if desirous to pour out his lesson while he remembered it . " a man upwards of forty marries a girl under twenty , he 's over sixty before she 's forty ; he 's decaying when she 's only mellow . i ought never to have struck you , i know . and you ' re such an infernal bad temper at times , and age does not improve that , they say ; and she 's been educated tip-top . she 's sharp on grammar , and a man may not like that much when he 's a husband . see her , if you must . but she does not take to the idea ; there 's the truth . disparity of ages and unsuitableness of dispositions -- what was it fellingham said ? -- like two barrel-organs grinding different tunes all day in a house " .
0	what are you doing here , then ? " i will pay my way , " said barney almost sullenly , " or i will stay at home " .
0	he never owned no sheep ; and the old ' oomen 's cows was let to go on the land , as was best , and then the boys took to playing hopskotch there , with a horse or two over it at times , and now mr . puddleham has it for his preaching . maybe , sir , the lawyers might have a turn at it yet ; " but he did not mind such things " .

0	hands up ! frank leaped into the room with his rifle leveled directly at the leader .
0	bless your heart , child , i know you did not ! please come in !
0	there is so much to do , they may not let me come -- not soon . i am going into the desert again . soolsby frowned ; his lips worked . " when will you come back " ? he asked eagerly .
0	i think you must be becoming a convert to the theory of dreams yourself , barbara ; you are so very earnest , " she cannot remember , except that he seemed a gentleman , and that we held intercourse with him as such . now , that again is remarkable . we never told her , you know , of our suspicions of captain thorn " .

0	i know it could not embarrass you , molly , dear . you ' d be sure to find plenty of food for company , " oh , i do not think it will be very difficult , " molly replied . " major fern is a farmer . he probably has lots of hams in the smoke house and plenty of eggs in the hen house and milk in the dairy and preserves and pickles in the pantry , and if there is not enough bread the cook can make up some hot biscuits or corn bread " .

0	ha ! ha ! your wisdom is but folly , ang lique des meloises ! you would kill , and still spare your enemy ! that was the smelling-bottle of la brinvilliers , who took it with her to the great ball at the h tel de ville , where she secretly sprinkled a few drops of it upon the handkerchief of the fair louise gauthier , who , the moment she put it to her nostrils , fell dead upon the floor . she died and gave no sign , and no man knew how or why ! but she was the rival of brinvilliers for the love of gaudin de st . croix , and in that she resembles the lady of beaumanoir , as you do la brinvilliers !
0	the knife ! the knife !
0	crazed ! no , indeed ! -- i wish every man in london were as sane and sound as you are ! " and to-night we are to go in for them thoroughly , i suppose " ? -- inquired villiers with a quick look . " to-night , my dear boy , you will have to decide whether you consider me mad or sane , " said alwyn cheerfully -- " i shall tell you truths that seem like romances -- and facts that sound like fables , -- moreover , i shall have to assure you that miracles do happen whenever god chooses , in spite of all human denial of their possibility . do you remember whately 's clever skit -- ' historical doubts of napoleon i ' ? -- showing how easy it was to logically prove that napoleon never existed ? -- that ought to enlighten people as to the very precise and convincing manner in which we can , if we choose , argue away what is nevertheless an incontestible fact . thus do skeptics deny miracles -- yet we live surrounded by miracles ! . do you think me crazed for saying so " ?
0	get a guard and take me to headquarters , with five british officers on his heels , stan ditched the bike and sprinted for the gate . under shaded lights he saw two yank soldiers . he reached them ten yards ahead of the britishers , having outrun the secret-service men . the guards barred the way .

0	that does not sound very cordial , " if you want to " .
0	well , i rather think that adventure did net him a cool twenty , not so bad for a dip in the river .
0	she was quite irrelevant . " what did she say , " i asked .
0	nervous ? that giant ?
0	i can not , se or , i can not ! my nerve is gone . never , if i live to be a thousand , shall i forget that awful moment , that appalling ' smile end_sentence_quote i tell you there is wizardry in the thing ; the beast is bewitched . my work in the arena is done , done forever , se or . i shall never have courage to look into the beast 's jaws again .
0	oh , she is not so poverty-stricken as you think , she will not suffer . and then i wanted to ask you if there was not some way of helping helen in her art work . she wants so much to go abroad with miss preston , but has no more idea of ever being able to do so than she has of going to the moon . what would it cost , papa ? is not there some way of bringing it about ? could not you have a talk with miss preston and find out all about it , and then we could plan something , maybe .
0	of course she is ! her friends yonder are driving her to it ! could anything be more fitting ?
0	of coase ! ah would have my hawt in my moath all day long , too , if ah was living in a big hoase alone . " we should have been just as much scared any time after five o ' clock , " alma said to the sympathetic intelligence in the girl 's face .
0	that must be the schooner , she is taking a wise course , and is intending to run under cape cornwall , or maybe to get into saint ives bay , in case the gale should continue .
0	the girl scouts do not know what they ' re here for , they think it 's a party !
0	read it , read it , governor , no secrets , you know . everything above board here to-night .
0	no objection at all . i ' m simply nonplussed at the nerve of this fellow , coming back again . i guess you have heard what a narrow squeak he had with me . you ' re welcome to go anywhere , just so long as you do not disturb my study down there in the boathouse . i use that because it overlooks the bay -- just the place to study over knotty legal problems . " you see , " explained kennedy , watching the effect of his words as if to note whether carter himself had noticed anything unusual the night before , " we saw a light moving over here last night . to tell the truth , i half expected you would have a story to add to ours , of a second visit " .
0	i told you you could rely on brecon , what happened then ?
0	walter -- stand by that door , let no one in until they break it down .
0	i did , and if i ' d known it was you i would have come on by wireless .
0	we will try to remember , i suppose you are in the sixth form ?
0	that 's it ! i have a perpetual tan , and i think i can give you a temporary one which i keep in a bottle for the purpose .
0	i might ask you , major , what you are doing out of uniform ? " hal paine " ! he cried . " is it really you ? and what are you doing in that uniform " ?
0	of course i have . he nodded . " so do i . he 's cussed as a mule , but he 's a goer . he 's also a gentleman . have you noticed that " ?
0	i thought yours a more confidence-winning face , ermine . " so do i . and when you get the confidence at first hand , you will receive it with a better grace than if you had had a contraband foretaste " .

0	never mind the laws , i ' m not even thinking about the laws . frankly , if it would do any good , i might even consider breaking one or two of the laws , and the devil with my conditioning .
0	i feel reasonably sure of it . in fact , that 's partly why i do not want gregory to throw any more of wyllard 's money away . you have done all i expect from you .
0	i _have_ left them , and look at them .
0	a woman or a friar can not insult one . i contemplate living in peace for the time that i shall remain in this country and i do not want any more quarrels with men who wear skirts . besides , i have learned that the provincial has scoffed at my orders . i asked for the removal of this friar as a punishment and they transferred him to a better town ' monkish tricks , ' as we say in spain . " from laruja , who was telling it this morning in the office " .
0	i will have a meter , " i will be there , " he stated with businesslike decisiveness . " i will bring along from five to twenty thousand dollars ' worth of time and use up as much of it as you will let me " .
0	indeed i did not ! and will you take me home in that little car ? for i promised adele i ' d go at once .
0	if you will return the compliment and urge my suit with him , i am afraid he can not quite make up his mind about me , and i am so nice . i have not flirted nearly so much as people think , and my instincts are really quite domestic .
0	i know it 's hard , but , we ' re only supposing , you know .
0	from what i hear we will probably have a reserved seat for the show . we sit up there and watch . but we can always elbow in and fly a fortress or a liberator .
0	and the law offices had it all to themselves , well , it was a halcyon period . what sort of a man is mr . northwick , personally ?
0	here pretty go , major , devil and all to pay ! that my lord , he gone and bolted . this silly fool say that three hours ago he hear something break through fence and think it only hy na what come to steal , so take no notice . well , that hy na , you guess who he is . you come look , major , you come look , and then we tie this fellow up and flog him .
0	i love the king a little , and hate him a lot , " you never had any use for sage king , " said bostil , as if he had been wronged .
0	help ! help ! the startled steers nearest to him fought desperately to get away from the object that had so suddenly hurled itself against them . instantly there was a mix-up , with bellowing , plunging steers all about him .
0	once again ! the attorney thought it fun and shouted with him until they succeeded in stirring up the dying hurrahs .
0	i never paid a halfpenny for lodging nobut [ note 1 ] once , and that was th ' last night afore i got here . some nights i lay in a barn upo ' th ' hay : but most on ' em i got took in at a farm-house , and did an hour or two 's work for ' em i ' th ' morn to pay for my lodging and breakfast . but some on ' em gave it me right out for nought -- just for company like . i bought my victuals , of course : but i should ha ' wanted them wherever i ' d been . " and whence gat you the money for your lodging " ?
0	you have had her long enough ! it 's my turn now !
0	oh , you innocent ! that means you could spell them anywhere .
0	by my faith , gossip , you are right ! but now give me your news , since mine is worth so little . you who go from town to town , must come by many strange items .
0	i do not believe we have got any . i guess it 's all grass . " that 's right . well , now , you have got me here , you must let me make myself useful any way i can . i have got a spare month that i can put in here in venice , just as well as not ; i sha ' not want to push north till the frost 's out of the ground . they would not have a chance to try my gleaner , on the other side of the alps much before september , anyway . now , in ohio , the part i come from , we cut our wheat in june . when is your wheat harvest at middlemount " ?
0	jerry , you drink too much . " i will bet , " kennedy said . " look , any of you fellows want a real earthside whisky ? when we were crewing this expedition , why did not we bring someone with a knowledge of distilling , brewing and such " ?
0	crowfoot ! crowfoot ! they all jumped as high as they could and then climbed very fast , hand over hand , feet and legs pushing as if a wounded bear were after them . crowfoot reached the top first .

0	if monsieur le commandant has no objection , and somebody will lend me a revolver , i should love to take part with the battalion that was going to shoot me , " never mind , " said his preserver . " we will let you into a little secret . the dispatch you brought to us was a request that this division should join with your nearest brigades in a raid on the enemy 's lines . the allied artillery is even now lengthening its fuses , and we are on the point of giving the germans a surprise . will you find your way back , or -- " and he made an expressive wave of his hand in the direction of the german trenches .
0	you have got him guessing , a cab was awaiting them out in broad street and they entered it , and were driven rapidly uptown on the west side .
0	ba-by , mamma ! hush-aby !
0	but suppose they were to say they did love you , -- what then ? " i ' m not quite certain that manuel 's way of handling women is not the best after all , " he said musingly . " ride over ' em rough-shod , trample them under foot , kick them to one side and then ask them whether they love you or not . if they say they do not , all you have to do is to behave like a gentleman and leave them alone " .
0	as far as that goes , i presume some people might think it rather singular that we did not cross the pond in a regular liner ; but then they might suppose it was a case of economy with us .
0	why , he must be crazy ! " so he says " .
0	norma -- for the love of allah ! " would not i ? i like that " ! said miss slater , settling her eyeglasses on the bridge of her nose with a finger and thumb . norma had a momentary pang of sympathy ; she could never have been made to understand that a happy barnyard duck may look contentedly up from her pool at the peacock trailing his plumes on the wall .
0	they are not trying to force the passage of the bridge ! everything is for the best ! the volume of smoke was so great that they could no longer see the position of the enemy , but harry believed that so much metal must do great damage . although he was a lieutenant he had snatched up a rifle dropped by some fallen soldier , and he loaded and fired it so often that the barrel grew hot to his hand . lying so near the river , most of the hostile fire went over the heads of the invincibles , but now and then a shell or a cluster of bullets struck among them , and harry heard groans . but he quickly forgot these sounds as he watched the clouds of smoke and the blaze of fire on the other side of bull run .
0	give me your hand , andre and my maid are used to my vagaries , and your own countrymen will not mind . give me your hand , mr . ritchie .

0	but what words ! what heat and what foolishness ! you have not considered the alternative . when you do , you will not persist in your refusal . you will not do that in any case . we have spurs for the reluctant . and i warn you against giving me your parole under stress , and afterwards playing me false . i shall know how to find and punish you . meanwhile , remember your sister 's honour is in pawn to me . should you forget to return with the dowry , you will not consider it unreasonable that i forget to marry her .
0	have you lost your senses ? you are letting the stranger get off ; knock him down first , and then fight your quarrel out .
0	yes , " so here ye arre at last , " he said with a grin .

0	oh , come ! it has not been so bad , has it ?
0	here you are , was not that enough to call you names for ?
0	even on that of letting you have your own way ? " you do not know me , hadley , not after all these years , or you would not talk like that . i ' m not the man to be bullied or tyrannized or even lectured by a woman . my wife and i will understand each other perfectly . i shall make that quite plain from the outset . it 's only right . i give my wife -- my name , my fortune . i expect in return something from my wife . i think i have found just the right kind of girl -- unspoiled by society notions , sensible on every point -- "
0	you see he has not improved since we saw him last , frances , " william , william " ! expostulated mr . parsons , smiling .

0	come on ! the fat boy clucked to his pony , and the little animal started off . as they moved along , stacy used the persuasive spurs resulting in a sudden burst of speed .
0	get it ? steve , guessing what was coming , dived , but he was not quick enough and the ball landed with a round smack on his right ear . a wet tennis ball , thrown from the distance of a few feet , is capable of hurting considerably , and steve , dashing the water from his face , felt very much as though he had been kicked by a mule and had difficulty in keeping the tears from his eyes .
0	hurrah ! how did you get it ?
0	brutally ! why , dad , is not that the way to put it ? horses and cattle are bought and sold at auction , knocked down to the highest bidder , or purchased at a private sale . the stocks and bonds and securities in which you deal are handled in precisely the same way . and now , when you are in an extremity , when your back is to the wall , a man whom i had always supposed to be at least a gentleman calmly makes a bid for your daughter , and you , my father , are willing to sell ! is not brutality the fitting word for you both ? it seems so to me .
0	halt ! father de smet looked up . there , standing right in front of them in the tow-path , was a german soldier !
0	no , it is not neither ; and you ' re a little lie-girl , " well , it 's the truly truth , madge parlin " .
0	about what i have been telling you , this car .
0	yes , i was !
0	no , no , i did not mean that . take a chair , harvey , and tell me about the weather . " do not be frightened , dear . of course there is going to be a next time . all the rest of our lives . you did not think even for a minute that i would go back on you , did you , elsie " ?
0	pauline is not at home . that is a little beggarly orphan guy took it into his head to feed and clothe , till some opportunity offered of placing her in a respectable home . i have teased him unmercifully about this display of taste ; asked him what rank he assigned her in his catalogue of beautiful treasures . she extended her hand toward beulah , who , as may be supposed , made no attempt to approach her . mrs . chilton smiled , and , clasping the bracelet on her arm , discovered to her visitor the mistake .
0	put ' em up , tom ! _i_ do not want to kill you , but i will if i have to -- i ai not goin ' to rot in no jail just for stampin ' a dirty snake-to death !
0	poker is not so difficult ! if you ' d stop betting your head off on two pairs , mr . north , you would not find it so expensive .
0	you ' re wrong . it was not your father . i did not see him . no -- it was my sister . she 's never seen you , but all the same she knew enough to give me points . she told me i was a fool to suppose you were happy here . " oh , do not let us talk of him " ! edith exclaimed , swiftly .
0	silence ! now , the second question : does this order come from marshal bazaine ?
0	moving pictures , " to-night , " she began , " i want to hear about your good times -- the ' fun ' that every girl wants and needs . tell me , what do you enjoy most " ?
0	so this is your last free party , miss beatrice , it seems strange to think that when last we met you were a happy child , and now --
0	no , indeed , we should not , but i do not want you to give in to ellen to too great an extent , my dear . this is your home , and not my mother 's , and your ways must be the ways of the house .
0	perhaps i ' d better telephone him . " i did not consider it proper to listen to all he said , so i retired gracefully . from what i did hear , however , i gathered that he was vaguely offended at something . i tried to explain that i had been out late , but it did not go " .
0	that 's a very good reason , " because he is almost certain to make a deposit in the fourth national bank in a short time " .
0	i shall give him a thorough trial , i never yet had anybody to come and go abjectly at the word of command , and i think it will be a delightful novelty .
0	he makes too many mistakes , calls pincus lubliner a crook and a murderer yet , which his mother was my own father 's a sister . did you ever hear the like ?
0	you showed bad judgment -- as it turned out . the other made a decent show of resistance , but finally accepted the offer , saying : " you certainly are white to me . i want to apologize for making that attempt to sneak away that night -- i had a powerful good reason for not staying any longer " .
0	that would not wake papa , of course ! if we had a telephone i ' d send for the police ; but we have not . i ' m going to see if there 's any one there . a burglar 's a man , i guess , and i can not imagine myself being afraid of any _man_ !
